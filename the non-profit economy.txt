The merit economy

Alexander Zatko
Abstract
The prevailing belief concernig renumeration is, that the salient property of work reward is its exchange value and that workers increase their effort in proportion to the reward size. A number of studies however found, that reward caries also symbolic value, precevied by workers as a measure of their competence, or an indicator of their position in social hierarchy. Laboratory experiments and studies  based on survey data also suggest, that the symbolic function of reward is a more reliable predictor of the workers’ happiness, motivation and economic performance than its exchange value. The first claim of the presented paper is, that decoupling the two values and granting them in separate rewards can address certain problems associated with the existing remuneration mechanism, primarily the asymmetrical flow of exchange value leading to income inequality. In the second claim, the existing notion concerning ownership of the exchange value of profit is challenged. It is argued, that while the total revenue from sales of assets - a measure of the symbolic value - belongs to the workers who provided the direct labor, the proper recipient of the exchange value of profits should be all of mankind. Based on these ideas a new remuneration mechanism is proposed where the symbolic and the exchange rewards are separated and the exchange value of profit is used to fund a basic income-like distribution scheme. The second part of the paper describes framework of an economic system (NEO), implementing the proposed reward mechanism.
"..Now it is true that the needs of human beings may seem to be insatiable. But they fall into two classes – those needs which are absolute in the sense that we feel them whatever the situation of our fellow human beings may be, and those which are relative in the sense that we feel them only if their satisfaction lifts us above, makes us feel superior to, our fellows. Needs of the second class, those which satisfy the desire for superiority, may indeed be insatiable; for the higher the general level, the higher still are they. But this is not so true of the absolute needs - a point may soon be reached, much sooner perhaps than we are all of us aware of, when these needs are satisfied in the sense that we prefer to devote our further energies to non-economic purposes..."
John M. Keynes, Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren


Discussion
In 1930, in his essay "Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren" John M. Keynes (Keynes, 1930) described a vision of the world economy "hundred years hence", where most labor is done by machines, the economic problem solved and human interests focused to "live wisely and agreeably and well". Fifteen years remain to the onset of the hypothetical new era and due to the rapid advances in technology, the vision no longer seems unattainable. It is becoming clear, that it is not the inadequacy of technology, or the lack of resources that present the last obstacle to fulfill the vision. The final roadblock is inequal distribution of wealth, inadequate for an era where the need for human labor is rapidly disappearing from the production processes.
Economic inequality
The World Economic Forum identified growing income inequality as one of the most pressing problems facing the world economy today, threatening stability of the social order as well (WEF, 2015; Dabla-Norris et al., 2015). The solutions of the problem presented to date have been primarily focused on redistribution of income or wealth through taxation (Piketty, 2014), or policy changes (Hacker, 2011), which for many reasons are encountering opposition. Analysis of relationship between worker motivation and income however sugests a new approach to the problem.
A number of behavioral studies show, that work reward has two functions - economic and symbolic (DeVoe et al., 2013;  Loewenstein & Sicherman, 1991; Kohn, 1993; Mickel & Barron, 2008). The former provides the recipients with economic value that can be exchanged for goods or services (exchange value), while the later is signaling  psychological and social values like competency, appreciation, recognition, status, or respect (the impact value). The impact value was found to be a better determinant of worker motivation, performance, or creativity than the exchange value of reward (Clark et al., 2008; Kohn, 1993; Ariely  et al., 2005).
These findigs lead to a new kind of answer to the question of the origin of income inequality. In the capitalist reward mechanism, the impact value is inseparable from the exchange value and therefore any attempt to reward impact, necessarily grants workers the exchange reward as well. A study by DeVoe et al. (2013) however shows, that income from own labor causes workers to increase their effort, as they see the reward as a signal of their competence (impact). Therefore the most rewared workers tend to acquire more reward, causing local accummulation of exchange value, that is over time further amplified by other mechanisms (Piketty, 2014).
A solution to this problem is suggested by the different attitude of workers towards the two functions of remuneration. A new reward mechanism, where exchange value of reward is separated from its impact value would allow setting the later as high as necessary, while keeping the exchange reward amount commensurable with the worker's actual effort. In such an arrangement, the likely principal reason driving accummulation of capital into an increasingly narrow segment of population would be eliminated, while keeping the motivational forces that give capitalism its dynamic character, intact.
A proposal to reward workers with non-exchangeable measure for impact is undoubtedly controversial. However, in addition to the above-cited research, another evidence of viability of such a reward scheme is existence of the volunteer economy, where every year more than a billion people worldwide (Salamon et al., 2011) are willingly exchanging labor for pure impact reward. Lastly, in a world, where physical presence, or material possessions are unavailable as signaling medium of status or abilities of an individual, new kinds of measures are needed to address our fundamental psychological and social needs (Deci & Ryan,1985). For example on the internet, the problem of non-existent physicality as a carrier of social signaling gave rise to a wide range of new measures not exchangeable for goods or services (Lifshits Y., 2008).
Profit and reward
A hypotehtical economy, where the exchange and the impact rewards are granted independently can be modeled by analyzing two existing economic systems, that implement mechanisms with only one of the two reward types.
The trillion dollars volunteer economy (Salamon et al., 2011) is a system, where workers are rewarded for their labor with pure impact reward, assuming various forms, depending on the type of work performed. For example, in the open source application development, the measure of impact might be the number of application installations, while in more traditional activities like community development work, volunteers are rewarded by gratitude expressed by the service recipients. In all cases, the size of the reward reflects utility of the created product or service rendered. 
Example of a system with reward having only the exchange function is Timebanking (Cahn, 2011) - a type of complementary currency - where one hour of work of any kind earns one time credit, exchangeable for an hour of another worker's work. For example, one hour of a doctor's work is considered equal in value to one hour of gardener's work. The model of worker motivation built upon the results of behavior research however predicts, that due to the absence of the impact measure in the reward, economies of this kind should not be viable in the long-term. A Timebanking study by Shih et al. (2015) confirms this prediction. It found an over time decreasing participation of timebank members, reluctance of higly-skilled members to trade their work for time credits and other issues. 
Yet, time-based remuneration is the base of not only alternative economic systems like Timebanking, but in certain contexts of the mainstream ones as well. For example, the capitalist remuneration is not different from Timebanking, when workers have the same type and level of expertise. In that case, any differences in the rewards recevied by different workers are attributable exclusively to the amount of their effort, commonly measured by the length of their work time. Therefore in systems, where impact is rewarded separately, any type of work performed with the same effort (taking the same length of time) has equal exchange value.
These examples show, that a remuneration mechanism, that combines utility-based impact reward with a separate time-based exchange reward, could - in the worker motivation domain - be equivalent to the capitalist system. It can be expected, that similar to the capitalist reward mechanism, also this new form of remuneration would motivate workers to maximize revenues from sales of the goods or services (assets) they make, as they are also a measure of utility of the asset, and therefore the workers' impact. The drive to maximize impact should lead to production of profit. That raises a question, about who should be the recipient of its exchange value, as the workers in a dual-reward economy only receive exchange reward that is equal to the number of their worked hours.
The answer to this question has two parts. The first comes from an observation (Ricardo, 1817), (Marshall, 1890), or (Sraffa 1960), that labor has two forms. The directly measurable and indirect, “contained” in the means of production. As the means of production were also created by labor using means of production, by applying recursion a series of terms is produced, where all but one member represent the labor contributions from the workers, whose work made the existence of the analyzed asset possible.  The last member in the series represents the natural resources, used to make the assets in the series.
The second part of the answer concerns the fact, that according to the definition of the concept, profit was created by the contributions of work from workers and a portion of the resources from the series, that are not a part of the input costs. Most of the workers however can't be rewarded, as they have been dead for a long time and natural resources do not have an individual owner. It is therefore reasonable to consider the exchange value of profit to be a part of cultural inheritance of mankind, to be distributed equally among all people.
Such perspective clashes with our innate assumptions about property rights and therefore also profit ownership. Those assumptions according to Eswaran & Neary (2011) are part of an old survival mechanism, which evolved under competition for scarce resources, one of which is the right to own resources developed by own labor. In capitalism, this right is manifested by the appropriation of profits by the individuals who produced them - either directly by own labor, or indirectly as owners of capital. Our evolution-formed assumptions about individual property rights however lose their validity, when economic and social stability of whole groups of people is at stake. Various types of taxes levied on income and personal property by governments of all historic periods and economic systems stand in a direct opposition to our assumptions about ownership rights to value developed by own labor.
The profit ownership problem can be solved by a new model of property rights, accounting for the fact, that work reward provides its recipients with two kinds of values. The impact measure of profit (the profit numerical value) should belong to the workers who created it, while its exchange value should be distributed among all people. This interpretation of property rights addresses the research-identified source of worker motivation and at the same time provides funding for an equal and universal distribution scheme like basic income.
Description of NEO
In this section a framework of a new economic system (NEO) is presented, incorporating the remuneration and property rights ideas discussed in the preceding section. The system assumes most of the institutions of the capitalist system, therefore only new rules and supporting concepts are described, followed by description of several typical scenarios. The goal is to provide just enough information to illustrate how the new rules could function in an economy. 
The infrastructure
In a departure from the capitalist system, which relies on its actors to know and follow the economy rules, in NEO, these are encoded into a software aplication called "Rovas". In addition to the economy rules, Rovas also implements interfaces that allow the NEO participants performing tasks like creating projects, entering work reports, paying for purchases, e.t.c. Interfaces are also available for facilitating programmatic access to the Rovas-stored data and functions. To ensure robustness, uninterrupted availability of services and prevent the possibility of direct human intervention, the software is deployed on a global, distributed computing platform, consisting of networked computers (nodes) owned by the economy participants (for example MaidSafe or Ethereum). From the governance point of view, development of the application follows the open source philosophy.
The economy actors
Any person wanting to participate in NEO can create a Rovas account. The registration process - among other requirements - ensures, that the applicant has exactly one account. Biometric information is also collected, to support various usage scenarios where ease of use and/or security concerns need to be addressed (authentication, payments authorization...).
Chron - the NEO currency
Based on the consclusions made in the Discussion section, the NEO remuneration mechanism calls for existence of two types of rewards, with two corresponding measures. The carrier of exchange value is a new digital currency called "Chron," with ten Chrons equal to one hour of average work effort. Chrons are created by Rovas, whenever a good or service is sold, as at that moment new value is created in the economy. The amount of Chrons created is in general equal to the revenues from sales, albeit a portion of the new Chrons is created in advance, as will be shown in the section describing the NEO economy rules.
The NEO currency stability is maintained by keeping supply of Chrons equal to the amount of value in the economy. This means, that as assets loose value over time, certain amount of Chrons must be removed from circulation. Measuring value loss is however practically impossible, therefore an indirect method is used. It is based on an assumption, that whenever a personal account is closed (for example due to the owner death), the lifetime economic value created by that person disappears from the economy. Considering, that the total economic value generated by an individual is equal to his/her impact score (discussed in the next section) and the total number of Chrons is always equal to the aggregate impact score of all economy actors, an amount of Chrons equal to the impact score attached to a closed account is removed from circulation.
Merit - the impact measure
The size of work reward, in addition to being the determinant of its exchange value, is perceived by its recipients also as measure of their impact. In the NEO reward mechanism, the impact reward is expressed by a new measure, with units called "Merit". Like Chrons, new Merits too are issued when new value is created in the economy, in an amount numerically equal to the created value. Therefore the amount of Chrons in circulation is always equal to the number of Merits awarded to all NEO workers. Merits can't be gifted or exchanged for goods or services, as they are a measure of individual worker's abilities. Merit scores of the economy participants are publicly accessible, alongside the information about the assets, for which they were granted.
The general NEO account
In addition to the accounts held by the economy participants, a special account exists in Rovas, used by the NEO rules for purposes that include temporary storage of Chrons before they are distributed to the economy actors and to store Merits that can't be assigned to a NEO participant.
Remuneration rules in NEO
The rules described here assume a simple economy, where workers interact with Rovas directly, as individuals. It is expected, that rules governing activity of firms and other types of institutions will be derived from the basic principles of the NEO economy and the rules described in this section.
It should also be noted, that NEO allows direct transactions between the economy actors using Chrons. In that scenario, none of the NEO rules are in effect and one of the consequences is, that no impact reward is awarded. In effect, the transacting parties are operating in a capitalist economy, using the NEO currency. To earn Merits, the economy participants must sell assets through Rovas-provided interfaces.
In NEO, workers are rewarded by Rovas with 10 Chrons for every hour worked. In order to receive a payment for their labor and the means of production they used while making an asset, they must submit a report to Rovas, containing among other information the ID number of the project for which the work was performed, along with the number of hours worked. If the desired project has no record yet in Rovas (and therefore no project ID), the worker (a project owner) must create it first, using the Rovas-provided interface. 
The revenues from sales of assets might fall into one of 3 ranges with different reward allocation rules. The ranges boundaries are:
A. no revenues
B. revenues equal to labor costs
C. revenues equal to labor costs plus the means of production costs
D. revenues exceeding all costs
Range 1 - the revenues do not exceed the labor costs
By default, Rovas repays only for that portion of the labor costs, that is equal to the revenues from sales. If workers are interested in advance payment for their work, they can send a work report as described above and fulfill one additinal requirement - to pass the physiological feasibility test. The goal of the test is to ensure that the reported number of hours is compatible with human physiology, to minimize reporting error and fraud. It is performed by Rovas, by calculating the average number of hours per day for the reported period. If the calculated number is smaller than 8 hours on average (more for shorter periods and less for longer periods), the test is considered passed. Once the test is completed, Rovas creates new Chrons and an equal number of Merits for the labor time the asset creator reported. The Chrons are deposited into worker's account and an equal amount of Chrons is substracted from the general NEO account ballance. The new Merits are held in the general NEO account until the worker sells the new asset. Only then the value of the asset's utility is revealed and the Merits can be assigned to the worker's account. Chrons received from the asset sale are deposited into the general NEO account, where they are used to liquidate the debit caused by the advance payment.
The need for paying workers in advance is the consequence of one of the fundamental principles of the NEO economy - the separation of the exchange and the impact signaing rewards - which dictates, that all effort (labor time) must be rewarded equally, regardless of the output value. Additional reasons why workers receive the advance payment for their work are:
1. issuing exchange reward in advance solves a bootstrapping problem, most apparent when NEO economy is launched. At that moment, no assets could be purchased, as no Chrons exist yet.
2. work output without value (one that does not sell) often plays positive role indirectly, for example as a source of (negative) experience other workers consider, when producing more successful work.
3. an asset may acquire value only after a signifficant delay, when the worker who created it can't be rewarded any more. 
Range 2
For revenues that are equal to, or exceed the labor costs, but are less than the sum of all input costs, NEO has different reimbursement rules, that depend on the origin of the means of production used. While the cost of the means of production originating in NEO (ones that have the NEO project ID) is reimbursed to the asset-producing workers, they receive no Merits for the new value created by the asset sale, attributable to the means of production. Instead, those Merits are paid to the (indirect) workers who created the means of productions. For means of production not originating in NEO, the newly-issued Merits are held in the general NEO account, as the means of production creators are unknown. Those Merits are periodically liquidated at a rate equal to the rate at which the economy assets loose value.
Range 3
Lastly, if the revenues from sales exceed all input costs, Rovas generates Merits and Chrons in the amount equal to the profit and distributes them accoring to these rules:
1. Merits are divided between the direct workers and the creators of the means of production used to make the sold asset. The share that each of these groups receive is by default proportional to their share of the input costs. Thus, for example the direct workers receive:
MeritsW = P * (Lc / (MPc+Lc))
...and the means of production creators receive:
MeritsMP = P * (MPc / (MPc+Lc))
where:
MeritsW - Number of Merits paid to workes who provided direct labor
MeritsMP - Number of Merits paid to workes who created the means of production
P - Profit
Lc - the direct labor costs
MPc - the means of production costs
When purchasing an asset to be used as a means of production, the buyer can agree to share any future potential impact reward with the seller, using other than the default - based on the sale price - credit allocation. If this is the case, the Rovas record for the sold asset must contain information about the agreed-upon Merit-distribution function.
If the means of production creators can't be identified, their share of Merits is again deposited into the general NEO account and over time liquidated as mentioned above.
2. Chrons from profits are deposited into the general NEO account, where they are used to cancel any debits from advances paid to workers. Any remaining Chrons are periodically and equally distributed among all NEO participants as the Universal Distribution.
Examples
Example 1: An entrepreneur creating a web application.
An entrepreneur starts work by creating new project in Rovas, by providing information like the name of the project, description and the choice of monetizing model. Upon submitting, Rovas generates unique project (asset) ID and associates it with the entrepreneur's ID. As she works on the project, the entrepreneur may record her work time, or do so upon reaching arbitrary milestones. Recording work time is not necessary, if she is interested only in the impact reward - as is the case with volunteer projects. If third party tools are needed, she will purchase them and record their asset IDs together with the portion of their value used in production. For means of production made outside the NEO economy, the entrepreneur will record only the portion of their cost used up in creating the web application.
In order to record sales, the entrepreneur will embed code into the web application, allowing Rovas to process payments received from users. If our entrepreneur would want to receive the advance payment for her work hours, she will indicate so in the project record. Rovas then checks if the number of work hours reported for the reported time period is realistic - not violating constraints dictated by human physiology. If that step is successful, Chrons for labor are created and deposited into the entrepreneur's account.
To sell her product, any of the strategies common in the capitalist economy can be used. For example, in a pay-per-use scenario, the buyer will authenticate into Rovas and confirm the payment. The web application will send a transaction into Rovas containing ID of the buyer, together with project ID. The Chrons from the buyer's account (managed by Rovas) will get transferred into the general NEO account and the buyer will gain access into the application.
To provide a more concrete picture of the rewards distribution, let's suppose the entrepreneur invested 100 hours of labor into creating the web application, which is equivalent to 1,000 Chrons. The entrepreneur also paid 100 Chrons for a program module with a specific functionality, needed in the web application. The total cost of web application is then 1,100 Chrons. Let's further assume, that the buyers collectively paid 20,000 Chrons for accessing the application. Rovas distributes rewards in the following way:
• the entrepreneur will receive 1,000 Chrons as an advance payment and once the web application generates enough sales, she is given additional 100 Chrons to cover the cost of the software module. She will also receive 20,000 - 100 = 19,900 Merits as the impact reward.
• the software module creator will receive the remaining 100 Merits, which is the default impact reward distribution, calculated from the input costs. If the module creator and the web application developer would have negotiated different distribution of Merits, that agreed-upon formula would be used instead to calculate the Merits allocation.
• The general NEO account will be credited with 20,000 Chrons from which 1,000 will be used to cancel the advance payment made to our entrepreneur and 100 Chrons will be transfered to her personal account to cover the software module cost. The remaining 18,900 Chrons will be used to cancel any advances made to other NEO workers and the rest will be divided among the economy participants as Universal Distribution payments.
If the entrepreneur would have choosen a "pay as much as you want" payment model, the web application visitor/consumer could either make a voluntary payment immediately within the application, or use it without paying. To encourage consumers to pay for assets sold under this payment scheme, Rovas might implement functionality allowing consumers to pay for such assets later. If for particular economy actor Rovas detected goods or services consumed, but not paid for, it would send a notification to the consumer about availability of a new usage statement. The statement - acessible within the Rovas application - would contain listing of all unpaid assets sold under the "pay as much as you want" payment model. The consumer could choose to pay separately for every good or service listed, or specify an arbitrarily high amount for all unpaid items, leaving it up to Rovas to distribute the payments.
Example 2: A team of workers making physical goods
A company owned and run by Jane, Mary and Bill produces sandwiches and resells them through a network of merchants. When starting the business, they made an agreement, to divide any impact reward from sales to 5 parts, with Bill receiving one and Jane and Mary 2 parts each, to reflect their individual value contributions. With the help of technology, they make 100 sandwiches in 1 hour, from 20 Chrons worth of ingredients. Other costs (amortization of machines, electricity...) contribute 0.1 Chron per sandwich. The total input costs per sandwich are 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.6 Chrons. The average sandwich price to the merchants is 1.5 Chrons. The company software sends periodically accounting information into Rovas, which issues Chron and Merit rewards to the workers' accounts. For one 8-hour day each of them earns 80 Chrons for labor and the total 1,200 Merits from the sale of the 800 sandwiches get divided among the workers according to the agreed-upon formula: 240 Merits for Bill and 480 Merits for Jane and Mary each. From the sales revenues, Rovas deposits 240 Chrons a day into the company account to reimburse the non-labor costs. The 720 Chrons remaining is deposited into the general NEO account. 
In this scenario, the workers would opt out of receiving advance payments, as sales and therefore the full work reward distributions are made every day.
It should also be noted, that in a marked departure from the capitalist model, the firm does not receive the exchange value component of profits, that in capitalism is often used to fund future business plans. In NEO, capital for business investments must be acquired from company employees individually or from outside investors as the exchange value of profits is a part of the common inheritance of mankind.
Example 3: Investing Chrons to earn Merits
This last example illustrates that the NEO economy actors can use their extra Chrons to increase their Merit score by investing into businesses, in exchange for a share of equity. In NEO, unlike in the capitalist system, where gains from such investments combine exchange as well as impact signaling functions, the investors receive only impact reward. The exact portion of Merits received is determined by negotiations between the investors and the entrepreneurs and the resulting agreed-upon distribution formula is used by Rovas to allocate the impact reward. The exchange value of profits is deposited into the general NEO account, to fund the Universal Distribution payments. Investing Chrons to gain Merits does not violate the principle of non-tradability of Merits, as the Chron holders must use their market knowledge to identify potentially successful enterprises, thus contesting their competence. Investing caries a real possibility of losing the investments, therefore investors are not simply buying Merits.
Conclusion
If history offers any insight into the likelihood of mass adoption of NEO, it is not a favorable one. None of the proposals made to date, aimed at addressing the known problems of capitalism have been succesful. While there are many opportunities for failure on the path to a succesful institution of NEO, some aspect of the proposal are more likely to cause problems than others. The challenge the new economy presents to the traditional assumptions about property rights, and to the established remuneration mechanism in particular is likely to be unacceptable to the majority of the middle and higher income workers. A mass adoption of NEO is therefore unlikely at least initially. The situation however might change, if the existing trend of the middle income jobs erosion continues (Boushey & Hersh,2012). However for specific types of economic actors, the NEO founding principles should not pose a barrier to adoption.
It can be expected, that NEO will be adopted by the same people, who today generate value in the world 7th largest - the volunteer economy (Salamon et al., 2011). By merely registering their projects in NEO and presenting them to the consumers as such, volunteers can receive not only an explicit (Merit) reward for their social contribution, but potentially also generate sales, funding their General Distribution payments. The amount of those rewards and payments would depend on the willingness of consumers to pay for the volunteer-made assets, but pricing strategies exist, suitable for this scenario. For example, the "pay what you want" (PWYW) might be a particularly good monetizing strategy. Gneezy et al. have shown, (Gneezy et al., 2010) that PWYW generated signifficantly more revenues than fixed pricing strategy, when part of the proceeds from sales were promised to be given to charity. Considering the overall pro-sociall and wealth-sharing character of the proposed economy, a similar behavioral response could be expected also when the same pricing scheme is used in NEO.
Another segment of population unlikely to be deterred by the NEO unorthodox rules, are the world poorest people. NEO offers everybody access to the Universal Distribution payments as well as the opportunity to earn Chrons for own work. The possibility to receive money for work on projects of one's own design makes it likely, that more often that not people will choose to produce assets beneficial to the society. Wealthy donors and governments, searching for the most effective way to maximize the impact of their resources, might find the NEO job-creating aspect attractive and support it by donating to or investing into NEO. The governemnt distributions and individual donations would be exchanged on the foreign exchange markets for Chrons and those in turn would fund the general NEO account. It can be expected, that the value of Chrons on the foreign exchange market will be initially low, allowing even small donations made in non-NEO currencies to buy large amounts of the NEO currency. The workers would use their Chrons to buy goods or services in the NEO economy, or - after converting Chrons on the foreign exchange markers - in the non-NEO economies.
Objections could be also brought up against the particular ways, the NEO founding principles are implemented, for example the equal effort rule that guarantees access to advance payment for simply reporting work hours. It can be expected, that the number of hours reported will not be accurate and may be inflated. In that case, two outcomes are possible - either such payments will be held in the workers' accounts, or they would be spent. Chrons that are not spent do not pose any threat, as they are eventually removed from the circulation when the account they reside in is closed. The Chrons that do get spend will increase the aggregate size of profits in the economy and that will lead to inflow of exchange value into the general NEO account, liquidating the debits from the advance payments. The constraint coded into Rovas, that ensures the number of hours worked is physiologically feasible, puts an upper limit on the number of hours a worker can report and thus also an upper limit to the amount of new Chrons created. Additionally, as the information stored in Rovas about assets will contain also their description and the location where they can be purchased, the economy participants could verify the assets existence.
If the ideas of the new economy attract enough creative people capable of producing valuable assets, not only false reporting of work hours will eventually reach its limit, but with growing income from the Universal Distribution, workers will cease reporting their work time altogether, focusing instead on maximizing their impact reward. Such a shift will signal arrival of the new era in human history, imagined almost one hundred years ago by John Maynard Keynes.

A table with several examples illustrating the NEO remuneration rules.

Legend: labor: the number of hours of direct labor; costs: the cost of means of production in Chrons; outside cost: “yes” if the means of production were purchased outside the NEO economy and “no” if they were produced in NEO; revenue - the revenue produced from the sales of the produced assets; profit/loss - the amount of profit or loss from the assets’ sales; new merits - the amount of new Merits created; merits to NEO - the share of Merits of the total earned without known recipient. The Merits are allocated to the general NEO account; merits to worker - the share of Merits granted to the worker who produced the asset; new Chrons - the amount of new Chrons created; effort (Chrons) - the exchange value earned by and paid to the worker; NEO bank - the share of produced exchange value flowing into the general NEO account.
