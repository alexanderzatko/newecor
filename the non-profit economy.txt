The non-profit economy

Introduction

This paper describes framework for a new economic model (NEO), built upon findings about relationship between income and happiness and global presence of non-profit volunteer work. These indicate, that a new remuneration mechanism, that takes these finding into account, has potential to resolve some of the most pressing problems of the capitalist economic system.

There are two observations in particular that served as inspiration for the new model:

1. Behavioral economics research shows, that emotional happiness rises with increasing income only to a certain country-specific level ($75,000 in the USA)[1].

2. Every year, about one billion people from around the world work for free, to produce socially beneficial output. In the process they generate value, that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by volunteers 7th on a list of the most GDP-producing economies[2].

From these findings an inference can be made, that once their basic material needs are satisfied, people loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy recognition from society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if their work is used and appreciated by other people. Based on these facts, the economic model proposed here rewards pro-social aspect of work by a non-material score, while establishing a natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Thus - in contrast to the remuneration mechanism of capitalist economic system (wage) - in NEO, work reward consists of two separate types:

1. effort - for the number of hours spent by workers to create a good or a service (asset). This reward is similar to wage, as it can be traded for goods or services.
2. impact - a numerical score, equal to the total sales revenue from an asset made by the rewarded worker. This reward is reflection of individual worker abilities, therefore can't be traded for goods or services.

The proposed model further postulates:
a. workers are materially rewarded only for effort and not for impact,
b. the amount of  material reward received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. The part of revenue remaining after workers are rewarded for effort (profit) is distributed equally to all NEO participants as Universal distribution.

It is envisioned, that NEO rules will be implemented as a set of algorithms, running on global, decentralized computing platform.

Discussion

Deflationary tendencies in the most developed economies, together with increasing pace of human labor elimination by advances in technology, signal arrival of new phase in the history of mankind, known as post-scarcity world. In that era, work to provide support for our physical needs and wants will be mostly eliminated and with it also the need for (material) remuneration. The transition into the new era presents several challenges.

1. Peer effects

Research shows, that peer effects, combined with wage amount differences result in emergence of differentiated consumption (consumption visibility gradient), that members of society use as a guide for improving their own social standing [18]. Most often, such efforts take the form of learning new skills, causing broad improvements in social capital. Loss of this motivation mechanism - inevitable in the materially equal world - would therefore be detrimental to cultural progress of individuals and the society in general.

Coincidentally, the same technological advances that are making transition to the material equality possible, also lead to creation of the internet and on-line social networks. Soon after social networks reached certain size, new value scales emerged, used to express various characteristics of the network members. For example, reputation score generated by users is an expression of expertise level on the stackexchange.com. Similarly, the news service reddit.com rewards users with karma points, that signify popularity of posts they make. In the on-line world, such ratings generate new kinds of motivation gradients. They can be made visible also in the physical world, using wearable technology, artificial intelligence and augmented reality applications. Using such technology their wearers/users will be able to learn about various characteristics of other individuals as they are observed, creating a functional equivalent to the consumption visibility gradient.

2. Economic inequality

The World Economic Forum identified growing income inequality as one of the most pressing problems facing the world economy today, affecting not only the world economy, but social and political order as well [14]. In the economic sphere, income inequality and saving rate inequality lead to concentration of wealth, causing levels of wealth inequality not seen since the beginnig of the last century. For example, in the US in 2012 the top 0.1% owned 20% of the country wealth [29]. Concentration of wealth is the main cause of the world-wide economic stagnation posing a barrier on the path toward world of material equality. Solutions for addressing this problem proposed to date have not found sufficient support among economists, or are politically unacceptable. However, results from human behavior research suggest, that several assumptions about worker motivation the capitalist reward system is built upon are incorrect. A new remuneration mechanism, respecting the research results, offers the possibility of a more robust solution to the income inequality problem.

The main findings relevant to this discussion are:
The capitalist remuneration model recognizes only exchange value of monetary reward, does not consider its source important and assumes work motivation to rise proportionally to the reward amount.
The research [30] shows, that monetary reward has two components - the exchange component that can be traded for goods and services and signaling component reflecting the worker competence. The source of reward is also important. Only reward received for worker's labor leads to desire to work more and harder. Money received from other sources like inheritance or stocks value gains do not increase motivation. A related study about source importance [32] suggest, that workers prefer to be rewarded for their labor due to the signaling property of this reward as it indicates their competence. The measure is important not only to the worker but also to the other members of society as a source of motivation for sel-improvement.

These results and results of the study concerning income amount and emotional happiness [1] lead to a conclusion, that motivation to increase the exchange component of reward has its limit. Once reached, workers prefer to maximize the amunt of the signaling reward component. Considering that it is a measure of worker competence, there is no reason why this reward could not have the form of a publicly visible numerical score, decoupled from the exchange component. The examples from the volunteering world show, that workers indeed are willing to produce real economic value [2] pro bono, if their work is rewarded by symbolic, but measurable way. A purely symbolic reward for utility of labor would eliminate the likely primary source of income inequality - that the competence reward is granted in a form, that can be exchanged for goods and services. This fact, combined with the positive feedback of reward received for their labor, leads well paid workers to seek an ever increasing amount of compensation.

A revised remuneration mechanism should be possible to design, where the competence value component of reward is expressed as a numeric score, independent of the exchange value component value. Such a construct would address the likely primary source of income inequality.


3. Profit and reward

Building an economic model that accommodates the new knowledge about human economic behavior requires a new method for allocating asset sale revenues among two new reward types. One - similar to the capitalist wage - t



 into a new requires finding suitable way to distribute value produced by the economy. In capitalism, this task is left to the market forces. These are in turn governed by a legal framework that defines property rights. that by mechanisms evolved

property rights -> appropriation of profit

 


As shown above, replacing the remuneration mechanism of capitalist system with a new one, where impact reward has non-material form, could both - eliminate income inequality and at the same time maintain the useful motivation gradient. 
The new remuneration mechanism needs to include two reward types: 
a. material - similar to wage of the capitalist system,
b. a new reward type, measuring impact of work output.
This brings up a problem of how the amounts of the two rewards should be determined. 



In capitalism, the sale price of an asset, as well as workers' remuneration are set dynamically by market forces. 


 complicating the task of constructing a simple rule for allocating rewards. 



To find the solution, a simplified model can be studied instead, where the work time is used as a carrier of value:

In an imaginary tribe, berry picker "A" can pick 1 liter of berries in 1 hour with her bare hands. The value of 1 liter of berries, expressed in the currency of the tribe is 1 H (equal to 1 hour of labor). Another - a more inventive - member of the tribe "B" creates wooden comb, that increases productivity 10-fold, to 10 litres per hour. Now the worker B has a surpluss of berries and needs to sell them. If the market demand is high, she can charge 1H for 1 liter. If there are many sellers of berries, she can lower the price, and sell them faster. In either case, she will generate profit, attributable to the use of her harvesting invention. Profit is calculated by substracting costs from the sales proceeds:

P = R - (Ct + Ht)

P	profit
R	revenue
Ct	time spend creating the comb
Ht	time spent harvesting

In actual numbers, her profit is P = 10 - (3 + 1)  = 6H (if we assume it took 3 hours to create the comb). In the future, profit gained from sale of berries will be higher, because the cost of the harvesting comb has been already paid for, when the first batch of berries was sold. 

To deterimine the proportion of the impact and effort portions of revenues, we need to consider the circumstances, that lead our entrepreneur to create the harvesting comb that was instrumental to making the profit.

Continuing to use the simplified scenario described in our example - in capitalism, profit made from the sale of an asset belongs to the worker who created it. This ovnership agreement is a part of a larger group of property rights, which - according to the theory put forward by Eswaran and Neary - codify beliefs, that have been built into human nature by evolution [28]. However, similar to biological species, also ideas and beliefs continue to evolve, to better fit the changing world.

If we examine the major factors that determine an individual's ability to produce profit-generating asset

1. abilities - the totality of personal characteristics like focus, perseverance, emotional intelligence, understanding of the market needs and asset production constrains... Abilities can be either inherited genetically or acquired by education/training.
3. creativity - a wild card determinant, that makes one of two workers' asset more profitable than the other's, with both having the same abilities and investing the same number of work hours.


, therefore a more logical recipient of reward for profit is the mankind.

This conclusion leads to the sought after solution for determining the amounts of the two types of rewards:

1. workers should be materially rewarded only for their time/energy exerted, not for profit generated by their work,
2. workers should receive non-material reward, equivalent in size to the revenue generated by sales of the assets they create,
3. profits should belong not to the gifted workers who made them, but equally to all members of the human population.

Description of NEO

NEO is a new economic model, incorporating the arguments presented in the Discussion section. It is described here as a set of modifications of the capitalist economic system.


1. All rules of NEO economy - for accounting, identity management, calculating and issuing rewards and distributions,... - are formulated in and enforced by a set of computer algorithms called "Rovas" [5]. It will be running on a platform supporting development of decentralized applications like the Safe network [24] - or Ethereum [25]. The technical details describing the platform and a specification of the Rovas algorithms will be provided in separate documents.

2. There are two reward types in NEO and two corresponding measures to express their values. The carrier of "material" value is a new digital currency, called "Chron" [26]. Chrons will be generated by work in the NEO economy according to these rules:
a. After completing asset creation, worker will submit a work report into Rovas, containing information about the number of worked hours and the amount of expenses incurred to make the asset.
b. Rovas will create one Chron for every worked hour and issue them to the worker as advance payment. The expenses will not be included in the advance payment, because they do not represent newly created value. Instead Rovas will pay that part of the costs later, from the revenue generated by the sales of the assets.
c. If revenues generated by the sales of the assets are insufficient to repay the advance payment, the difference will be substracted from the Universal distributions of the workers who made the assets. Additionally, the exact amount of Chrons that was substracted will be destroyed, as the value they represent was not created when new Chrons for the advance payment was issued.
d. The amount of advance payment a worker will be able to receive will depend on the size of unpaid balance of previous advance payments and on the size of Universal distribution. Initially, advance payments might be capped at the greater of a set value (for example 10 Chrons), or (say) 10 times the amount of the most recent individual grant of Universal distribution.
e. Considering that Chrons represent products of human labor whose utility decreases over time, there will need to be a mechanism that will remove Chrons that correspond to the lost value from circulation. In capitalism, inflation rate is the indicator the state banks use to control the amount of money in circulation. It can be used in NEO as well in addition to other rules, like the above-mentioned mechanism for destroying Chrons issued for work without value. Also Chrons from long-term passive accounts might be destroyed. These decisions will likely be made empirically, or with the help of computer modeling, as the state of our current knowledge does not allow us to measure utility of assets over their lifetime.

The impact reward, granted to workers for revenues generated by assets they produce has the form of numerical score, called "Merit". Merits are granted by Rovas to every worker who directly or indirectly participated on creation of an asset. Each of them receives a portion of the revenue generated by sale of assets they made, the size of which depends on several factors, described in the example below.  

3. The portion of revenues from sales remaining after workers' costs are repaid is periodically and evenly distributed to all NEO participants as Universal distribution. Universal distribution will cease to be distributed into passive accounts and long-term passive accounts will be disabled.

The following example illustrates the basic concepts and functions of NEO.

Example 1: An entrepreneur creating a web application.

An entrepreneur starts work by creating a new project in Rovas, providing information like name of the project, its description, e.t.c.. Upon submitting, Rovas will generate unique project ID and associates it with the entrepreneur's ID. As she works on the project, the entrepreneur keeps recording her work time. If third party tools are needed to complete the project, she will purchase them and record their Rovas asset IDs (a kind of project ID). Tools without ID do not have to be recorded - they have either been purchased outside of NEO and therefore are not paid with Chrons or the entrepreneur decided not to report such asset use.

In order to record sales, the entrepreneur will embed speciel code into the web application, connecting it into Rovas. This will allow automatic processing of payments received from users, or record information about usage of the web application. Lastly, the entrepreneur or another worker charged with selling the web application will have to choose a suitable monetizing strategy. Any of the strategies common in the capitalist economy can be used.

For example, in a scenario where access is allowed only to authenticated users who pay a set price, the buyer authenticates into Rovas[20] and confirms payment. The web application will send a transaction into Rovas, containing ID of the buyer, together with project ID. The Chrons from buyer's account (managed by Rovas) are transferred into NEO common account and the buyer is granted access into application. 

Rovas will add together all payments received from all buyers and substract them from all costs. Every Chron earned will get divided among workers involved in the asset production lifecycle (conception, design... sales, delivery) according to the number of work hours invested into creating the asset. To account for differences in the amount of training or education, better trained workers will be able to claim portion of their training costs as an expense and get paid more. Education and training expenses in NEO are considered to be tools, similar to the familiar ones - like pliers or eletrict drills. Tools increase productivity, or allow workers to perform actions that can not be done without them, so they must be compensated for the cost of the tools they use. The exact amount of such costs will probably have to be negotiated among the worker and the project owner, as the amount of specialised expertise provided by training will warry with the type of task performed.

All workers will also receive Merits for their work. The Merit reward will consist of two parts:

1. the base component, numerically equal to the worker' Chron reward
2. the negotiable component, reflecting a concrete worker's contribution to the market success of the good or service produced (profit). As we presently do not know how to measure individual intellectual contributions to products developed collectively, each worker's share of the total Merit reward will have to be negotiated by the workers.

Total Merit reward for a concrete worker:

Mw = Mbi + P*Ii

Mbi - the base Merit reward amount. It is equal to the number of Chrons earned by the rewarded worker
P - profit, equal to total revenue minus costs
Ii - the contribution of the rewarded worker to the asset's market success. The concrete amount (from interval 0 - 1) will likely have to be negotiated by the workers. There could be a default value for this parameter in Rovas, derived from the Mbi, by formula:

Iid = CHw/CHt

CHw - the number of Chrons earned by the worker
CHt - revenue (the total number of Chrons earned from asset sales)

As Mbi = CHw, and CHt = R (revenue), the final Merit reward would be calculated by:

Mw = CHw + P*CHw/R = CHw*(1 + P/R)


All workers participating on the production will start receive (Chron) payments as soon as first web application users (buyers) start paying for access. After all production costs are paid, profit is stored in Rovas and earmarked for Universal distribution.

NEO and the existing (outside) economy

Considering, that the proposed economic model will coexist with the outside economy for some time, some rules will need to be implemented, governing transfer of value between the outside economy and NEO.

1. At some point after NEO becomes operational, Chrons will be made available on currency markets to allow conversions to foreign currencies to allow NEO participants acquire goods from the "outside" economies and vice-versa, outside companies to buy goods traded in Chrons. It is hard to predict the exchange rate, but given that Chron is going to be always equal to one hour of human labor, its price should relatively quickly rise to at least the world average of minimum hourly wage. Due to the fact that price of human labor will be higher in NEO than the same amount of labor in local currencies of most of the world's poorest countries, economic benefits of NEO will first be manifested on mass scale in those countries.

2. Governments and individual donors will be encouraged to donate money to Neo. Such money will be used to buy Chrons in exchanges (making exchange rates more favorable to Chron holders) and subsequently distribute them as Universal Distribution to the NEO participants.

3. To provide incentive for people from outside economies to purchase Chrons, it should be possible also to buy Merits. The reason is, that money earned in the capitalist economy represent a mixture of effort and impact rewards and thus people should receive for their foreign currency not only Chrons, but also Merits. The procedure would involve exchanging foreign currency into Chrons first and then buy Merits using the - at the time current - Chron to Merit ratio of the NEO economy. It can be expected, that there will always be much more Chrons generated in a given period that Merits, therefore also the ratio will be quite small. It might mean that for 10 000 Chrons it would be possible to get only couple of Merits. 
Option to buy Merits should have double impact - allow rich foreign currency holders to receive some Merits for their money and at the same time not provide much incentives to NEO workers to buy Merits with their Chrons, because Merits should be generally non-tradeable. The most important part is, that interest in Chrons should improve exchange rate, which should further increase participation in the NEO economy.

Appendix

but this choice will lower the amount of Universal distribution the buyer will receive from NEO (mecahnism to be described later). A score derived from the average price paid by buyers of pay-as-you-wish assets and the price paid by a particular buyer will be visible to all users in order to promote pro-social behavior.

The third scenario, where anonymous users are allowed access to assets will likely be used only during transition period from capitalist to the NEO economy. It is envisioned, that in this case assets creators will not receive any Merits, but will be paid for at least a portion of their costs from funds received from sources like government subsidies wishing to promote employment and from charitable donations who accummuated wealth in the capitalist economies. Rules for these transactions will have to be developed.




Suppose the entrepreneur invested 1000 hours into creating the web application (asset 1) and paid 10 chrons to acquire asset 2 (for example a program with specific functionality, that is needed in the web application). The total cost of web application is then 1010 chrons. Let's further assume, that the consumers collectively paid 2000 chrons for accessing the web application.

The rewards will be shared between the asset 1 and asset 2 creators in the following way:

• Asset 1 creator (our entrepreneur) will receive 1000 chrons
• Asset 2 creator will receive 10 chrons
• Contribution to the Neo common account will be 990 chrons

• Asset 1 creator will receive (1000/1010)*990 = 980 merits
• Asset 2 creator will receive (10/1010)*990 = 10 merits


The amount of merits the asset creator receives will be calculated dynamically, as it depends on the number of purchases. Our entrepreneur would see her merit score grow with each new paying consumer. An important feaure of NEO is propagation of merit, which means that also creators of the assets used to create the web application would receive portion of merits - as shown above.

From the consumer point of view, upon arriving to the web application, they will be prompted to log in with their NEO account credentials. After successful login, one of these two scenarios would play out:

1. the entrepreneur specified "pay as much as you want" option in the Minimum price field. The consumer could make the voluntary payment at the time when accessing the web application, or continue without paying. Once a month the consumer will receive a NEO usage statement, listing all assets the account holder consumed but not paid for yet, that were priced with "pay as much as you want" value in the Minimum price field. The consumer could choose to pay individually for every asset, or specify one amount for all unpaid items, leaving it up to Rovas to distribute the payments.

2. The consumer would be prompted on the web application to pay for access by paying the Minimum price.

The above is an example from the digital domain. In the physical domain, an asset creator would have to contend with issues like how to control access to an asset (a lecture, use of skating ring, entry into an event,), or how to register (identify and count) NEO consumers. Given the dramatic technological developments we see on a daily basis, associated with quickly decreasing costs of electronics of all kinds, it can be expected that inexpensive devices capable of scanning NEO consumer's IDs (biometric, wearable devices, e.t.c.) powered by ambient energy sources and connected to an ubiquitous network will soon make connection between the physical and digital domains possible and affordable.




The capitalist remuneration mechanism leads to concentration of material wealth into hands of a small group of people, which in turns leads to deformations in economy (market manipulations, declining purchasing power by the majority of market participants...), political life (the role of big money in representative domocracies) and other areas (charity).
