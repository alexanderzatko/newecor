The non-profit economy

Introduction

This paper describes framework for a new economic model (NEO), built upon findings about relationship between income and happiness and global presence of non-profit volunteer work. These indicate, that a revision of the existing remuneration mechanism, that takes these finding into account, has potential to resolve some of the most pressing problems of the capitalist economic system.

There are two observations in particular that served as inspiration for the new model:

1. Behavioral economics research shows, that emotional happiness rises with increasing income only to a certain country-specific level ($75,000 in the USA)[1].

2. Every year, about one billion people from around the world work for free, to produce socially beneficial output. In the process they generate value, that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by volunteers 7th on a list of the most GDP-producing economies[2].

From these findings an inference can be made, that once their basic material needs are satisfied, people loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy recognition from society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if their work is used and appreciated by other people. Based on these facts, the economic model proposed here explicitly rewards pro-social aspect of work, while establishing a natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Thus - in contrast to the remuneration mechanism of capitalist economic system (wage) - in NEO, work reward consists of two separate types:

1. effort - for the number of hours spent by workers to create a good or a service (asset). This reward is similar to wage, as it can be traded for goods or services.
2. impact - commensurate with the total revenue from sales of assets. This reward is a reflection of individual worker abilities. As such, can't be traded for goods or services.

The proposed model further postulates:
a. workers are materially rewarded only for effort and not for impact,
b. the amount of  material reward received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. The part of revenue remaining after workers are rewarded for effort (a.k.a. profit) is distributed equally to all NEO participants as Universal distribution.

It is envisioned, that NEO rules will be implemented as a set of algorithms, running on global, decentralized computing platform.

Discussion

Deflationary tendencies in the most developed economies, together with increasing pace of human labor elimination by advances in technology, signal arrival of new phase in the history of mankind, known as post-scarcity world. In that era, effort to provide support for our physical needs and wants will be eliminated and with it also the need for (material) remuneration. The transition from capitalism into that era presents several challenges.

1. Peer effects

Research shows, that peer effects, combined with wage amount differences result in emergence of differentiated consumption (consumption visibility gradient), that members of society use as a guide for improving their own social standing [18]. Most often, such efforts take form of learning new skills, which brings along overall improvements in social capital. Loss of this motivation mechanism - inevitable in the materially equal post-scarcity world - would therefore be detrimental to cultural progress of individuals and the society in general.

Coincidentally, the same technological advances that are making transition to the post-scarcity world possible, also lead to creation of the internet and on-line social networks. Soon after these reached certain size, new value scales emerged, used to express various characteristics of the network members. For example, reputation score generated by users is an expression of expertise level on the stackexchange.com. Similarly, the news service reddit.com rewards users with karma points, that signify popularity of posts they make. In the on-line world, such ratings generate new kinds of motivation gradients. They can be made visible also in the physical world, using wearable technology, artificial intelligence and augmented reality applications. Using such technology their wearers/users will be able to learn about various characteristics of other individuals as they are observed, creating a functional equivalent to the consumption visibility gradient.

2. Economic inequality

A major obstacle to overcome on the path to post-scarcity world is finding solution for the problem of income inequality, as differences in incomes lead to concentration of wealth, which cause decrease of purchasing power for the majority of consumers. That is a cause of economic stagnation and other economic and social problems [14], slowing down transition towards the post-scarcity world. Additionally, existence of material differences between people is contradicting the basic premise of the new era - material equality.

Solutions for addressing income inequality proposed to date have not found sufficient support among economists, and/or are politically unacceptable (for example raising taxtes on wealthy). However, the results of behavioral science research and other related evidence [1][2][6] indicate, that a more systemic solution can be found, by revising the mechanism of capitalist remuneration. In particular, the research evidence offers interpretation, that workers expect to be rewarded for their work in two different ways:

A. For their "effort" - the time/energy invested into work. Similar to the wage of capitalist reward mechanism, "effort" reward can be used to satisfy the "material" needs and wants of workers (food, shelter, clothing, travel, entertainment...).

B. Workers also try to maximize "impact" of their work, reflected in desirability of assets they (co)create. This reward type is what motivates people to work on pro-bono projects, like community work, or open source program development. It is likely that maximizing impact is also the dominant motivation factor for workers to generate profit, especially in cases when their income already exceeded the emotional well-being maximum as identified in [1].

The capitalist remuneration system does not distinguish between these two needs, and rewards workers with a single - material - reward. Rewarding impact materially leads to unnecessary wasting of resources and is likely the primary cause of income inequality. The wealth-compounding mechanism described by Piketty [3] further builds upon this flaw of the capitalist system. Introducing a new remuneration mechanism, where impact reward takes "non-material" form, therefore offers possibility to eliminate the primary cause of income and by implication also wealth inequalities.

3. Profit and reward

As was shown above, replacing the single-component remuneration mechanism of capitalist system with a new one, consisting of distinct rewards for "effort" and "impact" could both - eliminate income inequality and at the same time maintain the useful motivation gradient. This brings up a problem of how the amounts of the two rewards should be determined. In the capitalist economic system, the sale price of an asset, as well as workers' remuneration are determined by the market, making the task of constructing a simple, general rule for allocating rewards difficult. To find the solution, a simplified model can be studied instead, where work time is used as a carrier of value:

In an imaginary tribe, berry picker "A" can pick 1 liter of berries in 1 hour with her bare hands. The value of 1 liter of berries, expressed in the currency of the tribe is 1 H (equal to 1 hour of labor). Another - a more inventive - member of the tribe "B" creates a wooden comb, that increases productivity 10-fold, to 10 litres per hour. Now the worker B has a surpluss of berries and needs to sell them. If the market demand is high, she can charge 1H for 1 liter. If there are many sellers of berries, she can lower the price, and sell them faster. In either case, she will generate profit, attributable to the use of her harvesting invention. Profit is calculated by adding the time needed to make the comb to the one hour of actual harvesting and substracting the resulting number from the sales proceeds:

P = R - (Ct + Ht)

P	profit
R	revenue
Ct	time spend creating the comb
Ht	time spent harvesting

In actual numbers, her profit is P = 10 - (3 + 1)  = 6H (if we assume it took 3 hours to create the comb). In the future, profit gained from sale of berries will be higher, because the cost of the harvesting comb has been already paid for, when the first batch of berries was sold.

In the capitalist system, profit attributable to abilities like talent, inventiveness or creativity of any kind ("creativity" for short), is considered a rightfull property of their gifted owner. However, creativity has no known cause - it is a statistical phenomenon, occurring in human population randomly [23]. Additionally, frequency of creativity occurrence is proportional to the size of human population, therefore a more logical recipient of reward for profit is the mankind.

This conclusion leads to the sought after solution for determining the amounts of the two types of rewards:

1. workers should be materially rewarded only for their time/energy exerted, not for profit generated by their work,
2. workers should receive non-material reward, equivalent in size to the revenue generated by sales of the assets they create,
3. profits should belong not to the gifted workers who made them, but equally to all members of the human population.

Description of NEO

NEO is a new economic model, incorporating the arguments presented in the Discussion section. It is described here as a set of exceptions to the capitalist economic system.

1. All rules of NEO economy are formulated in and enforced by a set of computer algorithms called "Rovas" [5], that will be running on a globally distributed computing platform. Rovas functions will include accounting, identity management, calculating and issuing rewards and distributions, e.t.c.. The Safe network [24] - a new platform for development of decentralized applications -
 or possibly Ethereum [25] will likely be the fondations for build Rovas. The Rovas technical details will be provided in a separate document.

2. There are two new reward types in NEO and two corresponding measures to express their values. The carrier of "material" value is a new digital currency, called "Chron" [26]. Chrons will be generated by work in the NEO economy according to these rules:
a. Upon completing asset creation, worker will submit a work report into Rovas, containing information about the number of invested work hours and the amount of expenses incurred to make the asset.
b. Rovas will create one Chron for every worked hour and issue them to the worker as an advance. The expenses will not be paid by the advance payment, but Rovas will pay also that part of the costs, once sufficient amount of revenue is generated by the sales of the assets.
c. If the advance payment is not repaid from the revenues generated by the sales of the assets, workers who produced them will get their Universal distribution shortened by the difference (see below for description of UD). Thus over time, the outstanding advance payments will be repaid from these Universal distribution payment deductions.
d. Initially, workers with outstanding advances will not be able to receive new ones for new work reports, but eventually - once NEO economy is sufficiently robust - every reported work should receive an advance payment, regardless of whether it ever generates any revenue. There are two reasons for this rule:
	I. it is expected, that cost of assets will continue fall to near zero over time and therefore also the cost of writeoffs from advances that do not get repaid should be negligible.
	II. liberal position toward paying workers for creating assets regardless of their utility, should support etrepreneurship[27].

The impact reward, granted to workers for revenues generated by assets they produce has the form of a numerical score, called "Merit". Merits are granted by Rovas to every worker who directly or indirectly participated on creation of an asset. Each of them receives a portion of the revenue generated by sale of assets they made, depending on several factors, described in the example below.  

A detailed description of monetary policy (creating and destroying Chrons, setting inflation rate, e.t.c.) will be provided in separate documents.

3. The portion of revenues from sales remaining after workers' costs are repaid (profit) is periodically and evenly distributed to all NEO participants as Universal distribution.

The following example illustrates the basic concepts and functions of NEO.

Example 1: An entrepreneur creating a web application.

An entrepreneur starts work by creating a new project in Rovas, providing information like name of the project, its description, e.t.c.. Upon submitting, Rovas will generate unique project ID and associates it with the entrepreneur's ID. As she works on the project, the entrepreneur keeps recording her work time. If third party tools are needed to complete the project, she will purchase them and record their Rovas asset IDs (a kind of project ID). Tools without ID do not have to be recorded - they have either been purchased outside of NEO and therefore are not paid with Chrons or the entrepreneur decided not to report such asset use.

In order to record sales, the entrepreneur will embed speciel code into the web application, connecting it into Rovas. This will allow automatic processing of payments received from users, or record information about usage of the web application. Lastly, the entrepreneur or another worker charged with selling the web application will have to choose a suitable monetizing strategy. Any of the strategies common in the capitalist economy can be used.

For example, in a scenario where access is allowed only to authenticated users who pay a set price, the buyer authenticates into Rovas[20] and confirms payment. The web application will send a transaction into Rovas, containing ID of the buyer, together with project ID. The Chrons from buyer's account (managed by Rovas) are transferred into NEO common account and the buyer is granted access into application. 

Rovas will add together all payments received from all buyers and substract them from all costs. Every Chron earned will get divided among workers involved in the asset production lifecycle (conception, design... sales, delivery) according to the number of work hours invested into creating the asset. To account for differences in the amount of training or education, better trained workers will be able to claim portion of their training costs as an expense and get paid more. Education and training expenses in NEO are considered to be tools, similar to the familiar ones - like pliers or eletrict drills. Tools increase productivity, or allow workers to perform actions that can not be done without them, so they must be compensated for the cost of the tools they use. The exact amount of such costs will probably have to be negotiated among the worker and the project owner, as the amount of specialised expertise provided by training will warry with the type of task performed.

All workers will also receive Merits for their work. The Merit reward will consist of two parts:

1. the base component, numerically equal to the worker' Chron reward
2. the negotiable component, reflecting a concrete worker's contribution to the market success of the good or service produced (profit). As we presently do not know how to measure individual intellectual contributions to products developed collectively, each worker's share of the total Merit reward will have to be negotiated by the workers.

Total Merit reward for a concrete worker:

Mw = Mbi + P*Ii

Mbi - the base Merit reward amount. It is equal to the number of Chrons earned by the rewarded worker
P - profit, equal to total revenue minus costs
Ii - the contribution of the rewarded worker to the asset's market success. The concrete amount (from interval 0 - 1) will likely have to be negotiated by the workers. There could be a default value for this parameter in Rovas, derived from the Mbi, by formula:

Iid = CHw/CHt

CHw - the number of Chrons earned by the worker
CHt - revenue (the total number of Chrons earned from asset sales)

As Mbi = CHw, and CHt = R (revenue), the final Merit reward would be calculated by:

Mw = CHw + P*CHw/R = CHw*(1 + P/R)


All workers participating on the production will start receive (Chron) payments as soon as first web application users (buyers) start paying for access. After all production costs are paid, profit is stored in Rovas and earmarked for Universal distribution.

NEO and the existing (outside) economy

Considering, that the proposed economic model will coexist with the outside economy for some time, some rules will need to be implemented, governing transfer of value between the outside economy and NEO.

1. At some point after NEO becomes operational, Chrons will be made available on currency markets to allow conversions to foreign currencies to allow NEO participants acquire goods from the "outside" economies and vice-versa, outside companies to buy goods traded in Chrons. It is hard to predict the exchange rate, but given that Chron is going to be always equal to one hour of human labor, its price should relatively quickly rise to at least the world average of minimum hourly wage. Due to the fact that price of human labor will be higher in NEO than the same amount of labor in local currencies of most of the world's poorest countries, economic benefits of NEO will first be manifested on mass scale in those countries.

2. Governments and individual donors will be encouraged to donate money to Neo. Such money will be used to buy Chrons in exchanges (making exchange rates more favorable to Chron holders) and subsequently distribute them as Universal Distribution to the NEO participants.

3. To provide incentive for people from outside economies to purchase Chrons, it should be possible also to buy Merits. The reason is, that money earned in the capitalist economy represent a mixture of effort and impact rewards and thus people should receive for their foreign currency not only Chrons, but also Merits. The procedure would involve exchanging foreign currency into Chrons first and then buy Merits using the - at the time current - Chron to Merit ratio of the NEO economy. It can be expected, that there will always be much more Chrons generated in a given period that Merits, therefore also the ratio will be quite small. It might mean that for 10 000 Chrons it would be possible to get only couple of Merits. 
Option to buy Merits should have double impact - allow rich foreign currency holders to receive some Merits for their money and at the same time not provide much incentives to NEO workers to buy Merits with their Chrons, because Merits should be generally non-tradeable. The most important part is, that interest in Chrons should improve exchange rate, which should further increase participation in the NEO economy.

Appendix

but this choice will lower the amount of Universal distribution the buyer will receive from NEO (mecahnism to be described later). A score derived from the average price paid by buyers of pay-as-you-wish assets and the price paid by a particular buyer will be visible to all users in order to promote pro-social behavior.

The third scenario, where anonymous users are allowed access to assets will likely be used only during transition period from capitalist to the NEO economy. It is envisioned, that in this case assets creators will not receive any Merits, but will be paid for at least a portion of their costs from funds received from sources like government subsidies wishing to promote employment and from charitable donations who accummuated wealth in the capitalist economies. Rules for these transactions will have to be developed.




Suppose the entrepreneur invested 1000 hours into creating the web application (asset 1) and paid 10 chrons to acquire asset 2 (for example a program with specific functionality, that is needed in the web application). The total cost of web application is then 1010 chrons. Let's further assume, that the consumers collectively paid 2000 chrons for accessing the web application.

The rewards will be shared between the asset 1 and asset 2 creators in the following way:

• Asset 1 creator (our entrepreneur) will receive 1000 chrons
• Asset 2 creator will receive 10 chrons
• Contribution to the Neo common account will be 990 chrons

• Asset 1 creator will receive (1000/1010)*990 = 980 merits
• Asset 2 creator will receive (10/1010)*990 = 10 merits


The amount of merits the asset creator receives will be calculated dynamically, as it depends on the number of purchases. Our entrepreneur would see her merit score grow with each new paying consumer. An important feaure of NEO is propagation of merit, which means that also creators of the assets used to create the web application would receive portion of merits - as shown above.

From the consumer point of view, upon arriving to the web application, they will be prompted to log in with their NEO account credentials. After successful login, one of these two scenarios would play out:

1. the entrepreneur specified "pay as much as you want" option in the Minimum price field. The consumer could make the voluntary payment at the time when accessing the web application, or continue without paying. Once a month the consumer will receive a NEO usage statement, listing all assets the account holder consumed but not paid for yet, that were priced with "pay as much as you want" value in the Minimum price field. The consumer could choose to pay individually for every asset, or specify one amount for all unpaid items, leaving it up to Rovas to distribute the payments.

2. The consumer would be prompted on the web application to pay for access by paying the Minimum price.

The above is an example from the digital domain. In the physical domain, an asset creator would have to contend with issues like how to control access to an asset (a lecture, use of skating ring, entry into an event,), or how to register (identify and count) NEO consumers. Given the dramatic technological developments we see on a daily basis, associated with quickly decreasing costs of electronics of all kinds, it can be expected that inexpensive devices capable of scanning NEO consumer's IDs (biometric, wearable devices, e.t.c.) powered by ambient energy sources and connected to an ubiquitous network will soon make connection between the physical and digital domains possible and affordable.




The capitalist remuneration mechanism leads to concentration of material wealth into hands of a small group of people, which in turns leads to deformations in economy (market manipulations, declining purchasing power by the majority of market participants...), political life (the role of big money in representative domocracies) and other areas (charity).
