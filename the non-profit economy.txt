The non-profit economy

Introduction

This paper describes framework for a new economic model (NEO), built upon findings about relationship between income and happiness and growing global presence of non-profit volunteer work. These indicate, that a revision of the existing remuneration mechanism, that takes these finding into account, has potential to resolve some of the most difficult problems of the capitalist economic system.

There are two observations in particular that served as inspiration for the new model:

1. Behavioral economics studies show, that happiness rises with increasing income only to a certain level ($75,000 in the USA)[1].

2. Every year, about one billion people from around the world work for free to produce socially beneficial output. In the process, they generate value that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by volunteers 7th on a list of the most GDP-producing economies[2].

From these findings an inference can be made, that once their basic material needs are satisfied, people loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy recognition from society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if their work is used and appreciated by other people. Based on these facts, the economic model proposed here explicitly rewards pro-social aspect of work, while establishing natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Thus - in contrast to the remuneration mechanism of capitalist economic system (wage) - in NEO, work reward consists of two separate types:

1. effort - for the number of hours spent by a worker to create an economic good.
2. impact - for the (positive) difference between price of a good and effort needed to create it.

The proposed model further postulates:
a. workers are materially rewarded only for effort and not for impact,
b. the amount of  material reward received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. Positive difference between cost of good and its price is distributed equally to all NEO participants as a Universal distribution.

It is envisioned that NEO rules will be implemented as a set of algorithms, running on global, decentralized computing platform.

Discussion

The increasing pace of elimination of human labor by advances in technology, signal arrival of new phase in the history of mankind, commonly known as post-scarcity world. In this era, the effort to provide support for our physical needs will be eliminated and with it also the need for (material) remuneration. The transition presents several challenges.

1. Peer effects

Research shows that peer effects, combined with wage amount differences result in emergence of differentiated consumption (consumption visibility gradient), that members of society use as a guide for improving their own social standing [18]. Most often, such effort is manifested by learning new skills, which brings along overall improvements in social capital. Loss of this motivation mechanism would therefore be detrimental to cultural progress of individuals and therefore also the human society in general.

Coincidentally, the same technological advances making transition to the post-scarcity world possible, also lead to creation of the internet and on-line social networks. Once they reached certain size, new value scales emerged, used to express various characteristics of network members. For example, reputation score generated by users is an expression of expertise level on the stackexchange.com and karma of reddit.com is an expression of popularity of posts made by the service users. In the on-line world, these measures serve as new signaling mechanism, functionally equivalent to the consumption visibility gradient. Wearable technology and augmented reality applications will likely make these virtual ratings visible in the physical world as well, for example by allowing their wearers/users to check various ratings of other individuals as they are observed.

2. Rewarding creativity

A major obstacle to overcome on the path to post-scarcity economy will be  finding a solution for the problem of income and wealth inequality [14]. The reason is, that existence of material wealth differences between people is contradicting the basic premise of the approaching era - material equality.

In capitalism, granting different workers material rewards of inequal size for the same worked amount of time (or effort, as measured by energy expediture) is considered to be fair, if the better rewarded workers are more productive. The intuitive reason is, that people who through their work increase productivity are more creative than others. However, as creativity is an act of free will[17], the differences in remuneration make sense only if freee will actually exists. If the opposite is true, one of the most fundamental beliefs of capitalism - that innovators need to be rewarded - must be reconsidered.

The presented model assumes, that free will is an artefact of incorrect modeling  (an illusion) [ex. dennet]. From this assumption follows, that profit gained from selling a good does not belong to the worker who created it, as the creative abilities needed to make/market and sell it are not a product of the worker's effort. In NEO, creativity is assumed to be an emergent statistical quality of social networks with profit belonging to the network - the mankind as a whole.

These inferences lead to several outcomes:
1. profits are the natural source for an Universal distribution (basic income),
2. workers should be materially rewarded only for their time/energy exerted, not for utility of their work manifested as profit,
3. A worker who created profit-generating good, should receive non-material reward, equivalent in size to the profit amount. As has been shown in the Peer effects section, such "virtual" ratings can be used to construct replacement for the socially useful consumption visibility gradient.

Description of NEO

Overcomming the prevailing belief that material reward proportional to the profit amount should be granted to the worker who created the profit-generating good presents a challenge. The solution proposed here is based on evidence, that workers can be motivated by non-material means, if these reflect utility of their work [volunteering, studies about intrinsic motivation]. 

NEO therefore introduces a non-material reward type called "Merit," granted to workers as a compensation for profit, generated by selling goods they create. For the actual time spent working, NEO workers are paid with digital currency called "Chron". Both rewards are calculated and granted by algorithm ("Rovas"), from data provided by the workers and sales information from users of the produced goods. The following example illustrates the basic concepts and functions of the model.

Example: An entrepreneur creating a web application.

An entrepreneur starts work by creating a new project in Rovas, providing information like name of the project, its description and NACE classification, e.t.c.. Upon submitting, Rovas will generate unique project ID and assign it to the entrepreneur using her ID.

As she works on the project, the entrepreneur keeps recording her work time. If third party tools are needed to complete the project, she will purchase them and record their Rovas asset IDs (a kind of project ID). Tools without ID do not have to be recorded - they have either been purchased outside of NEO and therefore are not paid with Chrons or the entrepreneur decided not to report such asset use.

In order to measure utility, the entrepreneur will embed a special Rovas-connecting code into the web application, to process payments received from users, or record information about their usage. Lastly, the entrepreneur or another worker charged with selling the web application will have to choose a suitable monetizing strategy. In this example the strategy where access is allowed only to authenticated users who pay a set price will be described.

In that scenario, web application user authenticates into Rovas[20] and confirms the payment. A transaction, containing ID of the user, is sent into Rovas, together with project ID. The Chrons from user's account (managed by Rovas) are transferred into NEO common account and user is granted access into application. 
Rovas will add together all payments received from all buyers and substract them from all costs. If the result is positive (profit was reached), our entrepreneur as well as all other workers involved in the production are rewarded with Merits for portion of the generated profits. The workers participating on making, marketing and selling the web application must negotiate ahead of time, how Merits will be allocated between them and submit this information into Rovas.
The entrepreneur and all workers who participated on production will start receive (Chron) payments as soon as first web application users (buyers) start paying for access. After all production costs are paid, profit is stored in NEO common account and earmarked for Universal distribution.

The way tangible goods or services are sold and rewards distributed are variants of the strategies familiar from capitalist economy, modified to conform with the basic rules of NEO.

Appendix

The second scenario is similar to the first one, if the buyer pays some amount according to his/her choosing. Buyers who make choice not to pay anything will be penalized either materially by having some portion of their Universal distribution withdrawn, and/or 

but this choice will lower the amount of Universal distribution the buyer will receive from NEO (mecahnism to be described later). A score derived from the average price paid by buyers of pay-as-you-wish goods and the price paid by a particular buyer will be visible to all users in order to promote pro-social behavior.

The third scenario, where anonymous users are allowed access to goods will likely be used only during transition period from capitalist to the NEO economy. It is envisioned, that in this case goods creators will not receive any Merits, but will be paid for at least a portion of their costs from funds received from sources like government subsidies wishing to promote employment and from charitable donations who accummuated wealth in the capitalist economies. Rules for these transactions will have to be developed.




Suppose the entrepreneur invested 1000 hours into creating the web application (asset 1) and paid 10 chrons to acquire asset 2 (for example a program with specific functionality, that is needed in the web application). The total cost of web application is then 1010 chrons. Let's further assume, that the consumers collectively paid 2000 chrons for accessing the web application.

The rewards will be shared between the asset 1 and asset 2 creators in the following way:

• Asset 1 creator (our entrepreneur) will receive 1000 chrons
• Asset 2 creator will receive 10 chrons
• Contribution to the Neo common account will be 990 chrons

• Asset 1 creator will receive (1000/1010)*990 = 980 merits
• Asset 2 creator will receive (10/1010)*990 = 10 merits


The amount of merits the asset creator receives will be calculated dynamically, as it depends on the number of purchases. Our entrepreneur would see her merit score grow with each new paying consumer. An important feaure of NEO is propagation of merit, which means that also creators of the assets used to create the web application would receive portion of merits - as shown above.

From the consumer point of view, upon arriving to the web application, they will be prompted to log in with their NEO account credentials. After successful login, one of these two scenarios would play out:

1. the entrepreneur specified "pay as much as you want" option in the Minimum price field. The consumer could make the voluntary payment at the time when accessing the web application, or continue without paying. Once a month the consumer will receive a NEO usage statement, listing all assets the account holder consumed but not paid for yet, that were priced with "pay as much as you want" value in the Minimum price field. The consumer could choose to pay individually for every asset, or specify one amount for all unpaid items, leaving it up to Rovas to distribute the payments.

2. The consumer would be prompted on the web application to pay for access by paying the Minimum price.

The above is an example from the digital domain. In the physical domain, an asset creator would have to contend with issues like how to control access to an asset (a lecture, use of skating ring, entry into an event,), or how to register (identify and count) NEO consumers. Given the dramatic technological developments we see on a daily basis, associated with quickly decreasing costs of electronics of all kinds, it can be expected that inexpensive devices capable of scanning NEO consumer's IDs (biometric, wearable devices, e.t.c.) powered by ambient energy sources and connected to an ubiquitous network will soon make connection between the physical and digital domains possible and affordable.





2. Equality of effort.

In the capitalist economy, multiple factors set context of negotiations between worker and employer that determine wage amount. For example, workers might get paid differently for the same type and amount of work at different times, or at different companies. Another problem is, that wage amount varies wildly across pay spectrum, with often hard to justify high reward size received by upper management at one end, and low pay - insufficient to cover basic living needs - at the other.

In NEO, the amount of material reward a worker can earn in an hour does not depend on type of work. For example, an hour of computer programmer's work is rewarded materially the same as one hour of farm worker's manual labor. The reasons for this postulate come from results of behavioral economics research:

a. Paying people more than a certain (country-specific) amount does not lead to more happiness[1].
b. Increasing (monetary) reward does not increase preformance of creative workers - in fact it has the opposite effect[6].

Lastly, the capitalist remuneration mechanism leads to concentration of material wealth into hands of a small group of people, which in turns leads to deformations in economy (market manipulations, declining purchasing power by the majority of market participants...), political life (the role of big money in representative domocracies) and other areas (charity).

3. Cost of assets and price

All goods and services traded today in the world economies are made by human labor, augmented by varying amount of machine labor. The ratio of the two places assets on a scale, where on the one end are artisan products made largerly with human labor, and on the other are mass-produced assets, like individual instances of digital media made by electronic copying. The position a particular asset occupies on this imaginary scale is important, as everyday experience suggests, that assets made with large portions of machine labor have lower prices, than similar assets created by unaided human work. The cause of this phenomenon can be traced to the role machine labor plays in the cost structure of assets.

<picture assetCostStrucrure>

The picture above shows the lenghts of time - indicated by the bars width - needed to create two assets. The one labeled "1", is an asset created without use of machines. The graphics No. 2 below shows the same kind of asset, made with the use of machine labor. It can be seen, that making it requires roughly a quarter of human labor used to make asset 1 and the total number of hours to make it is also shorter - about 50% of the time needed to create asset No. 1. Considering, that producing any two assets of the same kind requires the same amount of unaided human labor, allows us to claim, that machine labor is equivalent to a certain amount of human labor:

Mhl = HL1 - HL2

Mhl - human equivalent of machine labor
HL1 - human labor needed to create an asset without use of machines
HL2 - human labor needed to create an asset with use of machines

To make buying and selling possible, a measure is needed, representing asset  exchange value (price). In NEO, is equal to the sum of hours of all workers who participated on asset creation - directly, or virtually:

a. direct labor - the time, the workers spend making parts for, or performing final assembly of an asset,
b. virtual labor - labor performed by machines. Machines are a class of assets that can make workers' labor more efficient, or perform work on their behalf. Examples of machines are tools, automata and robots[13] and their inseparable complement - the information (operating instructions, programs, know-how) guiding machine operation.

A question of critical importance is - who owns the machine labor? In the capitalist economy, machine labor belongs to the machine owner, who uses it to set asset prices, in order to generate profit for her/himself. In NEO, the machine owner is rewarded only for the actual number of work hours he or she performs and therefore can not individually materially benefit from machine labor. The ultimate reason why workers in NEO buy machines is to gain not profit, but impact reward.

These considerations are also reflected in the prices of assets, made widh machine labor. They are set to the cost of human labor, plus the cost of virtual human labor performed by machines. It can be shown, that the sum of these costs equals the total amount of labor human workers would have to perform, if they did not use any machines. The machine labor must be passed into an asset price in full, as throwing any portion of it away (lowering price) would unfairly benefit the asset buyer.

The portion of sales they generate is distributed to all people through mechanism of Universal Distribution (see below), and that indirectly lowers asset prices. The end effect is that in NEO, beneficiary of machine labor is mankind as a whole, reflecting the fact that machines have been built using knowledge of generations of our ancestors, extending successively each other's effort.

In practice, various pricing schemes can be imagined, that are conformant with the NEO postulates. For example:
a. a fixed price, determined by the asset creator. This pricing strategy will be mostly used for assets containing large proportion of human labor (artisan products). 
b. "pay as much as you wish". This pricing strategy might be used to sell mass-produced assets like articles on the web. A suggested price would be automatically provided, calculated by NEO algorithm from asset cost and the number of impressions made to date. Buyers would have choice not to pay anything, but if they should choose to do so, they would be always charged only for the relevant and amortised cost of human and machine labor, necessary to produce the impression.

In any scenario, buyers will be presented with a list of assets they consumed over a given period (monthly) with suggested prices, calculated by the algorithm from sales data gathered over that period. Shown will be also the amount of Universal Distribution granted to them, as a credit. To pay, the buyers will be able to choose to manually assign payments, or they could let NEO algorithm distribute a specified amount of money between the individual purchases. In any case, buyers will have no choice but to apply the Distribution grant first and completely to pay for the "pay as much as you wish" purchases. If they will not do so, NEO algorithm will distribute the grant automatically and only the (positive) difference would transfer to the regular buyer account.

NEO algorithm will use the proceeds of sales to pay the asset creators first for their work. The remaining part (for machine labor) will be transferred into Universal Distribution Fund. If sales should not cover the human labor portion of an asset cost, the workers would get paid for their work only partially.

4. Universal Distribution.

Most world economies today provide a varying degree of material support to people, who during certain time periods and for various reasons do not engage in activities producing tradeable goods or services. For example, to parents of small children, individuals incapacitated by illness, or to inventors, philosophers and theoretical scientists at times, when their work does not provide immediately appreciated value. Additionally, it can be expected, that accelerating technological advances (IT, automation, robotics) will have negative impact on ability of growing number of people to either find work, or earn wages above poverty level.

To address these issues, various schemes were suggested[9][10], some even experimentally tested for periods of time, but none have been permanently adopted. The proposed model derives mechanism for distribution of wealth from an idea, that value produced by machine labor belongs to all people. We see this idea play out every day already in decreasing pricese of most products, especially the mass-produced ones. However, capitalist system "implements" this idea through untractable mechanisms, allowing signifficant amount of machine labor-generated value to be appropriated by a small group of individuals[11]. 

Practical implementation of Universal Distribution...

Nomenclature

Non-human labor - labor performed by robots, software programs, automata.

Non-human-labor-generated value - asset value created by non-human labor. Includes also portion of value created by human labor - one made possible by use of tools. For example, a hole in the ground can be dug by bare hands, by using a showel, or an excavator. Value created in these three cases is increasing in listed order, because labor of human worker is made more productive by use of tools.

NEO - Economy built around the model described in this proposal (New Economic Order)

NEO participant - a person who has an account in NEO and participates economically in NEO

asset - a physical or virtual product, or service. A synonym to asset is "project"

consumer - a buyer or user of an asset.

Chron -  measure of "effort"; is the "material" currency of NEO, generated by human labor and issued by Rovas algorithm. Represents one hour of work.

Merit - measure for social "impact" of work. Considering that assets are most of the time produced by multiple workers, the impact reward granted to each of them is calculated by the following formula:

M = (h/H)*P  where:

M is size of the impact reward a worker receives
h is the number of hours a worker invested into making an asset
H is te sum of hours invested by all workers who participated on making an asset
P is the profit gained from the sale of the good 

NEO project - *****
Project Form - *****
Work Record Form - *****
Rovas asset ID - ***** 

Neo common account - an account holding Chrons that bellong to all members of NEO. These funds could be used to fund expensive projects (highways, starships...), serve as a source of universal distribution, e.t.c...

Rovas[5] - the distributed database/application, responsible for storing work reports, calculating rewards and implementing other NEO algorithms.

Rovas application - The user-facing part of Rovas, allowing workers to create projects, records about work they have performed, or to see all assets they visited during a given period of time.

Implementation

Rules of the proposed model will be implemented as a set of computer algorithms deployed into a distributed computing platform (Rovas). Security, privacy and technical details regarding policies governing instalation of new algorithms or new versions of old algorithms, will be described in a different document.

It is envisioned, that both new reward measures will exist only virtually, Chrons as digital currency stored in private accounts and Merits as numerical score, visible to the pubic. There will be no material objects (coins, bills) representing these measures that NEO participants could pass from one to another, but there might be technical solutions allowing physical representation of the Merit score, for example using augmented reality techniques within wearable devices, allowing users to see each other's Merit score.



NEO and the existing (outside) economy

Considering, that the proposed economic model will coexist with the outside economy for some time, some rules will need to be implemented, governing transfer of value between the outside economy and NEO.

1. At some point after NEO becomes operational, Chrons will be made available on currency markets to allow conversions to local currencies to allow NEO participants acquire goods from the "outside" economies and vice-versa, outside companies to buy goods traded in Chrons. It is hard to predict the exchange rate, but given that Chron is going to be always equal to one hour of human labor, its price should relatively quickly rise to at least the world average of minimum hourly wage. Due to the fact that world average price of human labor will be higher in NEO than the same amount of labor in local currencies of most of the world's poorest countries, consequences of this move will be dramatic. 

2. Governments and individual donors will be encouraged to donate money to the Neo common account. Such money will likely be used to buy Chrons in exchanges and subsequently distribute them as Universal Distribution into NEO participants. Optionally, states could create their own banks and use Chrons they purchase to finance state projects.

Notes:

1. It is possible that the character of large projects financing will change from the current centralised model to one based on ad-hoc crowdsourcing, where individuals themselves will be financing projects they like. This might be the preferred option as it gives more direct control over use of funds to the people who finance projects.

2. A physiological limit exists for the number of hours during which an individual can sustainably perform work and the algorithm "running" NEO will not allow workers to report more worked hours than this limit.
