The non-profit economy

Introduction

This paper describes framework for a new economic model, built upon findings about relationship between income and happiness and growing global presence of non-profit volunteer work. These indicate, that a revision of capitalist remuneration mechanism, which takes into account pro-social aspect of work has potential to solve some of the most pressing problems of the current world economy.

There are two observations in particular that served as inspiration for the new model:

1. Recent behavioral economics studies show, that happiness rises with increasing income only up to a certain level ($75,000 in the USA)[1].

2. Every year, about one billion people from around the world work for free to produce socially useful work. In the process, they generate value that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by volunteers 7th on a list of the most GDP-producing economies[2].

From these findings an inference can be made, that once their basic material needs are satisfied, people loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy recognition from the society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if their work is used and appreciated by other people. Based on these facts, the economic model proposed here explicitly rewards pro-social aspect of work, while establishing natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Thus - in contrast to the remuneration mechanism of capitalist economic system (wage) - in the proposed model, work reward consists of two separate types:

1. effort - for the number of hours a worker works to complete a particular job,
2. impact - for the lenght of time the product or service rendered by the effort is used.

The proposed model further postulates:
a. workers are materially compensated only for effort and not for impact,
b. size of  material compensation received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. all participants benefit equally from value generated by non-human labor.

It is envisioned that rules of the proposed model will be implemented as a set of algorithms, running on a global, decentralized computing platform.

Discussion

1. two types of rewards for performed work.

The basic premise of this paper is a belief, that problems caused by the work reward mechanism of capitalist economic system (unemployment, declining real wages, income inequality..) can be solved by adopting a new reward model, that takes into account social impact of work. This notion is based on a growing body of evidence:

1. people worldwide are willing to work for free on socially beneficial projects, 
2. behavioral economics studies revealed, that increases in material reward for performed work cease to make workers happier after reaching certain limit,
3. millions of people are daily creating content on internet social networks only to increase their social standing, measured with newly-invented instruments like Facebook "likes", or Youtube ratings.

In the proposed model, "impact" reward is the reflection of social value of work, calculated from the cummulative lenght of time during which product or service created has been used. The size of this reward is different for different types of work, reflecting its usefulness and therefore its value. Unlike wage of the capitalist economic system, this reward can not be directly traded for material goods or services, but like wage acts as work motivation mechanism in the new model.

The second reward type is given for "effort" and is equal to the number of hours needed to create products or services. This reward can be exchanged for goods or services, which makes it similar to the existing time based community currencies[7] like Time Dollar.

2. Equality of effort.

In the capitalist economy, multiple factors set the context of negotiations between worker and employer that determine wage amount and the opaque nature of the process is cause of many problems. For example, workers might get paid differently for the same type and amount of work at different times, or at different companies. Another problem is, that wage amount varies wildly across pay spectrum, often with excessive amount of compensation received by upper management at one end and low pay - often insufficient to cover basic living needs - at the other.

In the proposed model, the amount of material reward a worker can earn in an hour does not depend on type of work. For example, an hour of computer programmer's work is rewarded materially the same as one hour of farm worker's manual labor. The reasons for existence of this postulate come from results of behavioral economics research:

a. Paying people more than a certain (country-specific) amount does not lead to more happiness[1].
b. Increasing (monetary) reward does not increase preformance of creative workers - in fact it has the opposite effect[6].

Lastly, the capitalist remuneration mechanism leads to concentration of material wealth into hands of a small group of people and that in turns leads to deformations in economy (declining purchasing power by the majority of market participants), political life (the role of big money in representative domocracies) and other areas (charity).

3. Price

In order to allow buying and selling, a measure must be established representing exchange value (price) of assets. In capitalism, prices are set primarily by  market conditions and manufacturing constrains. In the proposed model, they are derived from the number of work hours performed by human labor and the amount of labor performed by machines (includes use of tools, robots and software programs). In particular, 

Workers are materially compensated only for the time they invest into creating assets and any productivity gains made possible by use of tools or machines are distributed equally to all people. This distribution has twofold effect - it lowers asset prices for their buyers and contributes to automatic payments received by all economy participants in form of basic income.

In practice, a buyer will see one of two types of prices:
a. a fixed number, determined by the asset creator. This pricing strategy will be mostly used for assets containing large proportion of human labor (artisan products).
b. "pay as much as you wish". In this scenario asset consumers will be presented with a list of assets they consumed over a given period (monthly) with suggested prices, calculated by the algorithm from sales data gathered over that period. The buyer will have a choice to pay the presented amount in full, or in part.

 will set either the minimum acceptable price, or minimal number of buyers, which together with known production costs allows the minimum acceptable price to be calculated.

4. Profit

Profit generation is one of the defining characteristics of capitalist economic system. It has likeley evolved to provide means for survival during economical downturns, but other important factors (serving as a measure of success) contribute to its existence and amount. In the proposed model, workers are materially rewarded only for the number of work hours spent on creating assets. Generating profit, while not explicitly prohibited, is incompatible with several aspects of the proposed model:

a. A physiological limit exists for the number of hours during which an individual can sustainably perform work and the algorithm "running" the proposed economy will not allow workers to report more worked hours than this limit.
b. Market pressures are a profit-attenuating force also in the proposed economy. Workers can in most cases create lower-priced products, aiming for goals different than material gains (see "c" below).
c. Most importantly, it is expected that workers will be motivated to increase the size of impact and not the effort rewards, therefore generating material profit will not be interesting to them.

It should be noted, that similar to the capitalist system, also in the proposed model, workers are paid only if the assets they produce find consumers. However, unlike the capitalist system, participants in the proposed economic system receive basic income (see below), removing existencial pressure as well as a need to manipulate prices to gain profit.

5. Basic income.

Most world economies today provide a varying degree of material support to people, who during certain time periods and for various reasons do not engage in activities producing tradeable goods or services. For example, to parents of small children, individuals incapacitated by illness, or to inventors, philosophers and theoretical scientists at times, when their work does not provide immediately appreciated value. Additionally, it can be expected, that accelerating technological advances (IT, automation, robotics) will have negative impact on ability of people to either find work, or to earn wages above poverty level.

To address these issues, various schemes were suggested[9][10], some even experimentally tested for periods of time, but none have been permanently adopted. The proposed model derives mechanism for distribution of wealth from an idea, that value produced by non-human labor should belong to all people. We see this idea play out every day already in decreasing pricese of most products, especially the mass-produced ones. However, capitalist system "implements" this idea through untractable mechanisms, allowing signifficant amount of non-human-labor-generated value (NHLGV) to be appropriated by a small group of individuals[11]. An important factor contributing to the current state of affairs is non-existence of a reliable measure of NHLGV, contained in products. The proposed mechanism can measure amount of human labor invested into product creation, as well as value of a particular product, measured by the total lenght of time during which it was in use. Substracting the amout of human labor from value of a product gives the amount of NHLGV. This is the source of basic income in the proposed model.

Nomenclature

Non-human labor - labor performed by robots, software programs, automata.

Non-human-labor-generated value - asset value created by non-human labor. Includes also portion of value created by human labor - one made possible by use of tools. For example, a hole in the ground can be dug by bare hands, by using a showel, or an excavator. Value created in these three cases is increasing in listed order, because labor of human worker is made more productive by use of tools.

NEO - Economy built around the model described in this proposal (New Economic Order)

NEO participant - a person who has an account in NEO and participates economically in NEO

asset - a physical or virtual product, or service. A synonym to asset is "project"

consumer - a buyer or user of an asset.

Chron -  measure of "effort"; is the "material" currency of NEO, generated by human labor and issued by Rovas algorithm. Represents one hour of work.

Merit - measure for social "impact" of work. It is calculated from the total number of hours an asset was in use. Considering that assets are most of the time produced by multiple workers, the impact reward granted to each of them is calculated by the following formula:

M = (h/H)*C  where:

M is size of the impact reward a worker receives
h is number of hours a worker invested into making an asset
H is sum of hours invested by all workers who participated on making an asset
C is the number of hours the asset was used

NEO project - *****
Project Form - *****
Work Record Form - *****
Rovas asset ID - ***** 

Neo common account - an account holding Chrons that bellong to all members of NEO. These funds could be used to fund expensive projects (highways, starships...), serve as a source of basic income, e.t.c...

Rovas[5] - the distributed database/application, responsible for storing work reports, calculating rewards and implementing other NEO algorithms.

Rovas application - The user-facing part of Rovas, allowing workers to create projects, records about work they have performed, or to see all assets they visited during a given period of time.

Implementation

Rules of the proposed model will be implemented as a set of computer algorithms deployed into a distributed computing platform (Rovas). Security, privacy and technical details regarding policies governing instalation of new algorithms or new versions of old algorithms, will be described in a different document.

It is envisioned, that both new reward measueres will exist only virtually, Chrons as digital currency stored in private accounts and Merits as numerical score, visible to the pubic. There will be no material objects (coins, bills) representing these measures that NEO participants could pass from one to another, but there might be technical solutions allowing physical representation of the Merit score, for example using augmented reality techniques within wearable devices, allowing users to see each other's Merit score.

The following example illustrates basic concepts of the model.

Example - An entrepreneur providing services in the digital domain.

An entrepreneur decides to create a web application, for example an on-line forum for people with some common interest. She starts work by creating new NEO project, using the Project Form interface that is a part of Rovas application. The form will contain fields for name of the project, its description, NACE classification and type of the product, choosing from the following options:
1. individually consumable asset - asset that can be consumed by a single consumer (smartphone, hammer, house...).
2. group consumable asset - an asset that can be simultaneously consumed by a non-infinite number of consumers (a lecture)
3. mass consumable asset - an asset that can be infinitely duplicated (article on a web portal, software..)

This infrmation will be used by Rovas to set price of the asset.

Upon submitting, Rovas will generate unique ID for the project and in addition to the entered data, will record also the author's ID.
Next, every time she works on the project, the entrepreneur will fill-in a Work Record Form. If the work calls for use of any assets (tools, services), she will purchase them and record their Rovas asset ID into the Work Record Form, or another form (tbd) designated for tracking expenses. Assets without Rovas asset ID do not have to be recorded - they have either been purchased outside of NEO and therefore are not paid with Chrons or the entrepreneur decided not to report the asset use.
In order to get rewarded, she will embed a special tracking code into the application she is developing. This code will record duration of every event when the web application is used, together with ID of the user and send these data into Rovas. Recording user ID assumes that the user is authenticated. This step will be made transparent to the user, as all applications running on the NEO network (economy) will share user's authenticated state, using an ubiquitous persistence layer provided by the network Rovas will run on.

After completing the application, Rovas will sum up and record the time the entrepreneur invested into development. If any assets with Rovas asset ID were used, then Rovas will retrieve the sum the entrepreneur paid to acquire them and records that number separately.

Suppose the entrepreneur invested 1000 hours into creating the web application (asset 1) and paid 10 chrons to acquire asset 2 (for example a program with specific functionality, that is needed in the web application). The total cost of web application is then 1010 chrons. Let's further assume, that

1. the NEO tracking code embedded in the web application recorded 1 000 000 visits averaging 1 minute each.
2. the consumers collectively paid 1010 chrons for accessing the web application.

The rewards will be shared between the asset 1 and asset 2 creators in the following way:

• Asset 1 creator (our entrepreneur) will receive 1000 chrons
• Asset 2 creator will receive 10 chrons

• Asset 1 creator will receive (1000/1010)*1000000 = 990100 merits
• Asset 2 creator will receive (10/1010)*1000000 = 9900 merits

An important feature of the proposed model is dynamic character of the rewards granted. In particular, it means that Rovas will deposit chrons into the entrepreneur's account only when the web application consumer(s) pay for it. If the asset 1 was of a type 1 (individually consumable asset), then this situation is similar to trading goods or services in capitalist economy. However, if the asset is consumable by more than one consumer (this is our case), cost of the asset is being repaid over time, as the consumers consuming it pay the minimum price specified by the asset creator on the Project Form. The minimum price might range from "pay as much as you want" to a specific, fixed amount.

Refering to our example, let's assume that the entrepreneur set the minimum price to 1/1000th of a chron. Let's also assume that the assets needed to build the web application were paid in full by our entrepreneur, to keep the situation simple. In this case, the entrepreneur will receive payments as the consumers buy access to the web application. The first consumer will contribute 1/1000th of a chron and after the 100th purchase, the entrepreneur's Rovas account will show balance 0.1 of a chron. The entrepreneur will get fully reimbursed when the 1 000 000th consumer makes a purchase. At this point access to the web application could be made free to any further consumers. However, to motivate consumers to pay for assets, any additional payments could be used to reimburse the previous consumers. It means, that the cost of access would progressively drop not only for the new consumers, but also for all consumers who already paid. Thus, at some point not only the asset creator would be fully reimbursed, but the dynamic, crowdsourced price would become so small, that all consumers who ever made the purchase would end up having paid almost nothing. The NEO community could decide to program Rovas to stop lowering the price at some set level, with all new payments credited into the NEO common account.

The amount of merits the asset creator receives would also be calculated dynamically, as it depends on the number of consumers. Our entrepreneur would see her merit score grow with each new paying consumer. An important feaure of NEO is propagation of merit, which means that also creators of the assets used to create the web application would receive portion of merits - as shown above.

From the consumer point of view, upon arriving to the web application, they would be prompted to log in with their NEO account credentials. After successful login, one of these two scenarios would play out:

1. the entrepreneur specified "pay as much as you want" option in the Minimum price field. The consumer could make the voluntary payment at the time when accessing the web application, or continue without paying. Once a month the consumer would receive a NEO usage statement, listing all assets the account holder consumed but not paid for yet, that were priced with "pay as much as you want" value in the Minimum price field. For each asset name the statement would show date consumed and the unpaid portion of the asset's development cost. The consumer would be encouraged to pay individually for every asset, or specify one amount for all unpaid items, leaving it up to Rovas to distribute the payment.

2. The consumer would be prompted on the web application to pay for access by paying the Minimum price.

Regardless of the scenario, on the consumer's "account" page of the Rovas application, he or she would notice first a drop of the balance indicating an asset(s) purchase. Over time however, affected by payments of other consumers buying the same asset(s), the account ballance would grow by the amounts automatically deposited by Rovas. It can be assumed that this effect will form consumers' behavior to pay for assets more and more often, as they will get used to see their Chrone balances recover with the passage of time.

The above is an example from the digital domain. In the physical domain, an asset creator would have to contend with issues like how to control access to an asset (a lecture, use of skating ring, entry into an event,), or how to register (identify and count) NEO consumers. Given the dramatic technological developments we see on a daily basis, associated with quickly decreasing costs of electronics of all kinds, it can be expected that inexpensive devices capable of scanning NEO consumer's IDs (biometric, wearable devices, e.t.c.) powered by ambient energy sources and connected to an ubiquitous network will soon make connection between the physical and digital domains possible and affordable.

NEO and the existing (outside) economy

Considering, that the proposed economic model will coexist with the outside economy for some time, there are certain rules governing transfer of value between the outside economy and NEO.

One question in this context is, whether outside money (or assets) can be freely exchanged for chrons. There are pros and cons:

Pro:

It is likely, that NEO will - in the transitore period before reaching self-sufficiency - not produce enough assets to satisfy its participant's needs. Therefore allowing unrestricted trade is desirable to satisfy this need.

Con:

Allowing free transfer of value might result in transfer of economic inequality, if large portion of outside individually owned wealth is transfered into NEO. However, given that chrons are generated by socially useful labor, there will likely never be enough of them to pay for the outside wealth, which will dictate an exchange rate unfavorable to massive Chron purchases with outside capital.


Not only chrons can't be directly exchanged for "foreign currencies", but chrons will not be possible to use for paying for outside assets (assets without NEO ID).

However, donors and governments will be able to give money to NEO's "foreign currencies" bank accounts.
