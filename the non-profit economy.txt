The merit economy

Introduction

"..Now it is true that the needs of human beings may seem to be insatiable. But they fall into two classes – those needs which are absolute in the sense that we feel them whatever the situation of our fellow human beings may be, and those which are relative in the sense that we feel them only if their satisfaction lifts us above, makes us feel superior to, our fellows. Needs of the second class, those which satisfy the desire for superiority, may indeed be insatiable; for the higher the general level, the higher still are they. But this is not so true of the absolute needs - a point may soon be reached, much sooner perhaps than we are all of us aware of, when these needs are satisfied in the sense that we prefer to devote our further energies to non-economic purposes..."

John M. Keynes, Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren

The premise of this paper is, that technological advances are providing humans not only with means but needs as well and these changes require a new type of economy.

This paper presents framework for a new economic model (NEO), based upon behavior research-identified dual nature of work reward and the unequal impact these functions have on worker motivation. The competence signaling function 

 two effects - its size is a competence signaling 



This paper presents framework for a new economic model (NEO), built upon results of research about effects of remuneration on worker motivation and incorporating ideas and experiences from two existing non-capitalist economic systems - the volunteer economy and Timebanking.

There are two observations in particular that served as inspiration for the new model:

1. Behavioral economics research shows, that emotional happiness rises with increasing income only up to a certain country-specific level ($75,000 in the USA)[1]. Further income increases either do not contribute to growth of happiness or have the opposite effect.

2. Every year, more than a billion people from around the world work for free, to produce socially beneficial output. In the process they generate value, that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by volunteers 7th on a list of the most GDP-producing economies[2].
 

From these and other observations an inference can be made, that once their basic material needs are satisfied, people loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy recognition from society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if their work is used and appreciated by other people. Based on these ideas, the economic model proposed here rewards pro-social aspect of work by a non-material score, while establishing a natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Thus - in contrast to the remuneration mechanism of capitalist economic system (wage) - in NEO, work reward consists of two separate types:

1. effort - for the number of hours spent by workers to create a good or service (asset). This reward can be exchanged for other assets.
2. impact - a numerical score, equal to the total sales revenue from an asset made by the rewarded worker. This reward is a reflection of individual worker abilities, therefore can't be traded for goods or services.

The proposed model further postulates:
a. workers are materially rewarded only for effort and not for impact,
b. the amount of  material reward received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. The part of revenue remaining after workers are rewarded for effort (profit) is distributed equally to all NEO participants as Universal distribution.

It is envisioned, that NEO rules will be implemented as and enforced by a set of algorithms, running on global, decentralized computing platform.

Discussion

In 1930, in his essay "Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren" John M. Keynes [37] described a vision of the world economy "hundred years hence", where most labor is done by machines, the economic problem solved and human interest changed to "live wisely and agreeably and well". Fifteen years remain to realize the vision and due to the rapid advances in technology, deliberations about the end of human labor have moved from the realm of science fiction to scientific publications and articels in mass media. To complete the transition, several obstacles will have to resolved first.

1. Economic inequality

The World Economic Forum identified growing income inequality as one of the most pressing problems facing the world economy today, affecting not only the world economy, but the social order as well [14]. In the economic sphere, income and saving rate inequality are causing wealth concentration, not seen since the beginnig of the last century. For example, in the US in 2012 the top 0.1% owned 20% of the country wealth [29]. Yet, the solutions to the problem proposed to date have not found sufficient support among economists, or are unacceptable politically. The results from behavior research however suggest, that remuneration mechanism incorporating new knowledge about worker motivation, can provide a solution to the inequality problem. 

The reward system of the capitalist economy is built upon certain assumptions, concerning the effects of work reward on worker motivation: 
a. the salient property of reward affecting motivation is its exchange value,
b. the source of reward (own labor, investments gains...) is not important for motivation, only the reward size.
However, the results of behavioral research find these assumptions incorrect. The study [30] shows, that in addition to being a carrier of exchange value, work reward has also a second - competence signaling - function, if the reward source is labor of the rewarded worker. Additionally, workers are motivated only if source of the reward is their labor; rewards originating from other sources, like stock gains or lottery winnings, do not have the motivation effect. In other words, workers' primary interested is to maximize the competence signaling aspect of their reward and not its exchange value. Competence feedback plays an important part in the human quest for self-determination [33], providing explanation for these findings.

The model of worker motivation emerging from these findigs presents a likely answer to the question about the origin of income inequality. In capitalist system, the competence signaling function of reward is inseparable from its exchange function and therefore any attempt to reward competence, necessarily grants the recipient with the exchange reward as well. However, the pool of resources available for the exchange reward is finite, while the desire to maximize the competence reward is unbounded. Rewarding high performers according to their perceived impact thus leads to a zero sum game, where these individuals receive the bulk of the resources [31]. Separating the two functions would allow setting the competence signaling reward as high as necessary, without affecting the amount of the exchange reward, thus eliminating the likely main cause of income inequality.

2. Profit and reward

One way to model a hypotehtical economy, where the exchange and competence signaling functions are split into separate rewards is to analyze two existing non-capitalist economic systems, that implement reward systems with only one of the functions.

The $1,348.1 billion volunteer economy [2] is example of a system, where workers are rewarded for their labor with pure competence-signaling reward. The form of the reward varies for different types of services. For example, in the open source application development, competence might be signaled by the number of application installations, while in more traditional activities like community development work, volunteers are rewarded by gratitude expressed by the service recipients. In all cases, the reward reflects the utility of a product or service. In the capitalist economies, measure of utility of an asset are the revenues from its sales, which is easily measurable and therefore a suitable choice for the competence-signaling reward of the modeled economy.

Example of a system utilizing reward with only the exchange function is Timebanking - a type of complementary currency - where one hour of work of any kind earns one time credit, exchangeable for an hour of another worker's work. For example, one hour of a doctor's work is considered equal in value to one hour of gardener's work. The model of worker motivation built upon results of behavior research however predicts, that due to the absence of the competence signaling function in the reward, economies of this kind should not in general be viable in the long-term. A recent Timebanking study [35] confirms this prediction. It found an over time decreasing participation of timebank members, reluctance of higly-skilled members to trade their work for time credits and other issues. 

A conclusion can be drawn from this analysis, that most of the value of capitalist work reward comes from the competence signaling function. The remaining value is the amount of invested work effort, commonly measured by the number of worked hours. Considering, that differences in productivity are captured in the competence signaling portion of the reward, one hour of any type of work performed with the same effort (energy expended), are of equal exchange value. Therefore a new remuneration mechanism composed of a time-based exchange reward as known from Timebanking and a competence-signaling reward based on the amount of an asset's sales revenue, would both - satisfy the wide spectrum of social and economic needs, while conforming to the new model of worker motivation, derived from the behavioral science research.

It can be expected, that such a system will retain the motivational function of capitalist reward mechanism to maximize revenues and that will lead to production of profit. While in capitalism profit is owned by the workers (or capital owners) who made the assets, in the proposed system they receive exchange reward no greater than their share of the number of hours spent to make the asset. The recipient of the difference between revenues and the granted exchange reward  - profit - can be determined by the following line of arguments.

The assumptions we as individuals hold about property rights (and therefore also profit ownership), are according to Eswaran and Neary [28] part of a survival mechanism, that evolved under competition for scarce resources. One of the assumptions is the right to own resources developed by own labor, which in capitalism is manifested by the appropriation of profits by the individual who produced them. Yet, our assumptions about individual property rights loose their validity, when well-being of whole groups of people is considered. Various types of taxes, levied on income and property by governments of all historic periods and economic systems in order to maintain social and economic stability, are in a direct contradiction to the assumption of ownership right to resources developed by own labor.

The resulting struggle between interests of the individual and the collective for ownership of resources can be resolved by adopting a new perspective on property rights, founded on the knowledge, that rewards for products of labor cary two kinds of value - the competence signalling measure that belongs fully to the worker and the exchange value that includes profit, whose rightful owner is the collective. Such property rights model would address the needs of workers identified by the research and at the same time provide funding for universal distribution scheme like Basic income [9], which is increasingly considered by economists as the best option for addressing problems caused by the rapidly changing global economic landscape.

Description of NEO

The primary goal of this paper is to describe framework for a new economic system ("NEO"), with rules based on the new remuneration mechanism and property rights model, discussed in the previous section. The defining ideas of the new system are represented by the following rules:

a. the competence signaling reward is a measure of utility of assets, which in turn is measured by the amount of revenues from their assets sales.
b. workers are rewarded for the number of their work hours (their effort) with exchange reward. 
c. The size of exchange reward is independent of the work type (equality of effort).
d. The difference between the total revenue and the workers' exchange reward (profit) is distributed equally to all NEO participants, as Universal distribution.

From the implementation point of view, the rules of the economy will be encoded as software algorithms ("Rovas" [5]), running on a decentralized computing platform (for example [24] or [25]), with the economy participants peforming any value-related transactions exclusively via their networked computing devices. This implementation detail is important not only for technological reasons (robustness, security,..), but primarily to liberate the economy participants from the need to learn the new rules. The Rovas code development will follow the open source philosophy and deployment of new versions will require voting consensus of the majority of the economy participants. More detailed description of technical and governance aspects is not the focus of this paper and will be mentioned only if necessary to illustrate important concepts of the new economy design.

The NEO remuneration mechanism requires existence of two new measures, for the two new reward functions: 
1. the carrier of the exchange value is a digital currency called "Chron" [26] with one Chron equal to one hour of human labor,
2. the competence signaling measure is called "Merit," and its values are calculated from revenues attributable to the work of the rewarded worker.

In order to get paid, the NEO economy participants will use the Rovas interfaces (forms, AI digital assistant...), to create a record of their work. It will - among other information - include the number of worked hours, ID of project on which the work was performed and a list of any costs incurred. Using this information, Rovas will perform a check, to prevent submissions of errorneous or fraudulent reports, by making sure that the reported hours are not violating certain physiological constraints (can't work 24 hours every day) or the laws of arithmetics (day has only 24 hours).

Next, in accordance with the principle "b" (workers receive exchange reward for their worked hours), Chrons will be created for the reported work hours and transferred into the workers' Rovas-based personal wallets. While this construct might seem to be opening the doors to abuse, there are forces and mechanisms that should mitigate this threat:
1. only useful assets are rewarded with Merits. Therefore it is expected, that most workers will submit only reports for actually performed work on goods or services that are wanted and therefore also purchased.
2. The exchange reward will be issued immediately after filing the work report, but its amount will depend on a certain well-defined measure of the economy performance.
3. The exchange reward received for work 


depend on a certain well-defined measure of the economy performance. 


The second constraint concerns the fact, that not all work output is (immediately) useful. Such work in most economies does not find buyers and therefore does not get rewarded. The NEO economy position is, that according to the principle of work equality, workers should receive reward also for producing output that has no utility at the time of its creation. It is an acknowledgement to the fact, that even work with no apparent use may serve as a factor other workers consider, when producing more successful work. Furthermore, an asset utility is often found after a signifficant delay, when the worker who created it can't be rewarded any more. 






b. Rovas will create one Chron for every worked hour and issue them to the worker as advance payment. The expenses will not be included in the advance payment, because they do not represent newly created value. Instead Rovas will pay that part of the costs later, from the revenue generated by the sales of the assets.
c. If revenues generated by the sales of the assets are insufficient to repay the advance payment, the difference will be substracted from the Universal distributions of the workers who made the assets. Additionally, the exact amount of Chrons that was substracted will be destroyed, as the value they represent was not created when new Chrons for the advance payment was issued.
d. The amount of advance payment a worker will be able to receive will depend on the size of unpaid balance of previous advance payments and on the size of Universal distribution. Initially, advance payments might be capped at the greater of a set value (for example 10 Chrons), or (say) 10 times the amount of the most recent individual grant of Universal distribution.
e. Considering that Chrons represent products of human labor whose utility decreases over time, there will need to be a mechanism that will remove Chrons that correspond to the lost value from circulation. In capitalism, inflation rate is the indicator the state banks use to control the amount of money in circulation. It can be used in NEO as well in addition to other rules, like the above-mentioned mechanism for destroying Chrons issued for work without value. Also Chrons from long-term passive accounts might be destroyed. 


3. The portion of revenues from sales remaining after workers' costs are repaid is periodically and evenly distributed to all NEO participants as Universal distribution. Universal distribution will cease to be distributed into passive accounts and long-term passive accounts will be disabled.

3. Merits are granted by Rovas to every worker who directly or indirectly participated on creation of an asset. Each of them receives a portion of the revenue generated by sale of assets they made, the size of which depends on several factors, described in the example below.  



The following example illustrates the basic concepts and functions of NEO.

Example 1: An entrepreneur creating a web application.

An entrepreneur starts work by creating a new project in Rovas, providing information like name of the project, its description, e.t.c.. Upon submitting, Rovas will generate unique project ID and associates it with the entrepreneur's ID. As she works on the project, the entrepreneur keeps recording her work time. If third party tools are needed to complete the project, she will purchase them and record their Rovas asset IDs (a kind of project ID). Tools without ID do not have to be recorded - they have either been purchased outside of NEO and therefore are not paid with Chrons or the entrepreneur decided not to report such asset use.

In order to record sales, the entrepreneur will embed speciel code into the web application, connecting it into Rovas. This will allow automatic processing of payments received from users, or record information about usage of the web application. Lastly, the entrepreneur or another worker charged with selling the web application will have to choose a suitable monetizing strategy. Any of the strategies common in the capitalist economy can be used.

For example, in a scenario where access is allowed only to authenticated users who pay a set price, the buyer authenticates into Rovas[20] and confirms payment. The web application will send a transaction into Rovas containing ID of the buyer, together with project ID. The Chrons from buyer's account (managed by Rovas) are transferred into NEO common account and the buyer is granted access into application. 

Rovas will add together all payments received from all buyers and substract them from all costs. Every Chron earned will get divided among workers involved in the asset production lifecycle (conception, design... sales, delivery) according to the number of work hours invested into creating the asset. To account for differences in the amount of training or education, better trained workers will be able to claim portion of their training costs as an expense and get paid more. Education and training expenses in NEO are considered to be costs. Tools increase productivity, or allow workers to perform actions that can not be done without them, so they must be compensated for their costs. The exact amount of such costs will probably have to be negotiated among the worker and the project owner, as the amount of specialised expertise provided by training will warry with the type of task performed.

All workers will also receive Merits for their work. The Merit reward will consist of two parts:

1. the base component, numerically equal to the worker' Chron reward
2. the negotiable component, reflecting a concrete worker's contribution to the market success of the good or service produced (profit). As we presently do not know how to measure individual intellectual contributions to products developed collectively, each worker's share of the total Merit reward will have to be negotiated by the workers.

Total Merit reward for a concrete worker:

Mw = Mbi + P*Ii

Mbi - the base Merit reward amount. It is equal to the number of Chrons earned by the rewarded worker
P - profit, equal to total revenue minus costs
Ii - the contribution of the rewarded worker to the asset's market success. The concrete amount (from interval 0 - 1) will likely have to be negotiated by the workers. There could be a default value for this parameter in Rovas, derived from the Mbi, by formula:

Iid = CHw/CHt

CHw - the number of Chrons earned by the worker
CHt - revenue (the total number of Chrons earned from asset sales)

As Mbi = CHw, and CHt = R (revenue), the final Merit reward would be calculated by:

Mw = CHw + P*CHw/R = CHw*(1 + P/R)


All workers participating on the production will start receive (Chron) payments as soon as first web application users (buyers) start paying for access. After all production costs are paid, profit is stored in Rovas and earmarked for Universal distribution.

NEO and the existing (outside) economy

Considering, that the proposed economic model will coexist with the outside economy for some time, some rules will need to be implemented, governing transfer of value between the outside economy and NEO.

1. At some point after NEO becomes operational, Chrons will be made available on currency markets to allow conversions to foreign currencies to allow NEO participants acquire goods from the "outside" economies and vice-versa, outside companies to buy goods traded in Chrons. It is hard to predict the exchange rate, but given that Chron is going to be always equal to one hour of human labor, its price should relatively quickly rise to at least the world average of minimum hourly wage. Due to the fact that price of human labor will be higher in NEO than the same amount of labor in local currencies of most of the world's poorest countries, economic benefits of NEO will first be manifested on mass scale in those countries.

2. Governments and individual donors will be encouraged to donate money to Neo. Such money will be used to buy Chrons in exchanges (making exchange rates more favorable to Chron holders) and subsequently distribute them as Universal Distribution to the NEO participants.

3. To provide incentive for people from outside economies to purchase Chrons, it should be possible also to buy Merits. The reason is, that money earned in the capitalist economy represent a mixture of effort and impact rewards and thus people should receive for their foreign currency not only Chrons, but also Merits. The procedure would involve exchanging foreign currency into Chrons first and then buying Merits using the - at the time current - Chron to Merit ratio of the NEO economy. It can be expected, that there will always be much more Chrons generated in a given period that Merits, therefore also the ratio will be quite small. It might mean that for 10 000 Chrons it would be possible to get only couple of Merits. 
Option to buy Merits should have double impact - allow rich foreign currency holders to receive some Merits for their money and at the same time not provide much incentives to NEO workers to buy Merits with their Chrons, because Merits should be generally non-tradeable. The most important part is, that interest in Chrons should improve exchange rate, which should further increase participation in the NEO economy.

Appendix

but this choice will lower the amount of Universal distribution the buyer will receive from NEO (mecahnism to be described later). A score derived from the average price paid by buyers of pay-as-you-wish assets and the price paid by a particular buyer will be visible to all users in order to promote pro-social behavior.

The third scenario, where anonymous users are allowed access to assets will likely be used only during transition period from capitalist to the NEO economy. It is envisioned, that in this case assets creators will not receive any Merits, but will be paid for at least a portion of their costs from funds received from sources like government subsidies wishing to promote employment and from charitable donations who accummuated wealth in the capitalist economies. Rules for these transactions will have to be developed.

Separating competence and exchange functions will likely have a side effect of killing attractiveness of inheritance, because the recipient will receive no (coveted) merits. The exchange value gained will be useless in NEO.


Suppose the entrepreneur invested 1000 hours into creating the web application (asset 1) and paid 10 chrons to acquire asset 2 (for example a program with specific functionality, that is needed in the web application). The total cost of web application is then 1010 chrons. Let's further assume, that the consumers collectively paid 2000 chrons for accessing the web application.

The rewards will be shared between the asset 1 and asset 2 creators in the following way:

• Asset 1 creator (our entrepreneur) will receive 1000 chrons
• Asset 2 creator will receive 10 chrons
• Contribution to the Neo common account will be 990 chrons

• Asset 1 creator will receive (1000/1010)*990 = 980 merits
• Asset 2 creator will receive (10/1010)*990 = 10 merits


The amount of merits the asset creator receives will be calculated dynamically, as it depends on the number of purchases. Our entrepreneur would see her merit score grow with each new paying consumer. An important feaure of NEO is propagation of merit, which means that also creators of the assets used to create the web application would receive portion of merits - as shown above.

From the consumer point of view, upon arriving to the web application, they will be prompted to log in with their NEO account credentials. After successful login, one of these two scenarios would play out:

1. the entrepreneur specified "pay as much as you want" option in the Minimum price field. The consumer could make the voluntary payment at the time when accessing the web application, or continue without paying. Once a month the consumer will receive a NEO usage statement, listing all assets the account holder consumed but not paid for yet, that were priced with "pay as much as you want" value in the Minimum price field. The consumer could choose to pay individually for every asset, or specify one amount for all unpaid items, leaving it up to Rovas to distribute the payments.

2. The consumer would be prompted on the web application to pay for access by paying the Minimum price.

The above is an example from the digital domain. In the physical domain, an asset creator would have to contend with issues like how to control access to an asset (a lecture, use of skating ring, entry into an event,), or how to register (identify and count) NEO consumers. Given the dramatic technological developments we see on a daily basis, associated with quickly decreasing costs of electronics of all kinds, it can be expected that inexpensive devices capable of scanning NEO consumer's IDs (biometric, wearable devices, e.t.c.) powered by ambient energy sources and connected to an ubiquitous network will soon make connection between the physical and digital domains possible and affordable.
