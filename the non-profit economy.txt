The merit economy

Introduction

"..Now it is true that the needs of human beings may seem to be insatiable. But they fall into two classes â€“ those needs which are absolute in the sense that we feel them whatever the situation of our fellow human beings may be, and those which are relative in the sense that we feel them only if their satisfaction lifts us above, makes us feel superior to, our fellows. Needs of the second class, those which satisfy the desire for superiority, may indeed be insatiable; for the higher the general level, the higher still are they. But this is not so true of the absolute needs - a point may soon be reached, much sooner perhaps than we are all of us aware of, when these needs are satisfied in the sense that we prefer to devote our further energies to non-economic purposes..."

John M. Keynes, Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren

The premise of this paper is, that technological advances are providing humans not only with means but needs as well and these changes require a new type of economy.

This paper presents framework for a new economic model (NEO), based upon behavior research-identified dual nature of work reward and the unequal impact these functions have on worker motivation. The competence signaling function 

 two effects - its size is a competence signaling 



This paper presents framework for a new economic model (NEO), built upon results of research about effects of remuneration on worker motivation and incorporating ideas and experiences from two existing non-capitalist economic systems - the volunteer economy and Timebanking.

There are two observations in particular that served as inspiration for the new model:

1. Behavioral economics research shows, that emotional happiness rises with increasing income only up to a certain country-specific level ($75,000 in the USA)[1]. Further income increases either do not contribute to growth of happiness or have the opposite effect.

2. Every year, more than a billion people from around the world work for free, to produce socially beneficial output. In the process they generate value, that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by volunteers 7th on a list of the most GDP-producing economies[2].
 

From these and other observations an inference can be made, that once their basic material needs are satisfied, people loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy recognition from society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if their work is used and appreciated by other people. Based on these ideas, the economic model proposed here rewards pro-social aspect of work by a non-material score, while establishing a natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Thus - in contrast to the remuneration mechanism of capitalist economic system (wage) - in NEO, work reward consists of two separate types:

1. effort - for the number of hours spent by workers to create a good or service (asset). This reward can be exchanged for other assets.
2. impact - a numerical score, equal to the total sales revenue from an asset made by the rewarded worker. This reward is a reflection of individual worker abilities, therefore can't be traded for goods or services.

The proposed model further postulates:
a. workers are materially rewarded only for effort and not for impact,
b. the amount of  material reward received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. The part of revenue remaining after workers are rewarded for effort (profit) is distributed equally to all NEO participants as Universal distribution.

It is envisioned, that NEO rules will be implemented as and enforced by a set of algorithms, running on global, decentralized computing platform.

Discussion

In 1930, in his essay "Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren" John M. Keynes [37] described a vision of the world economy "hundred years hence", where most labor is done by machines, the economic problem solved and human interests focused to "live wisely and agreeably and well". Fifteen years remain to the hypothetical beginning of the new era and due to the rapid advances in technology, the vision no longer seems unattainable. It is becoming clear, that it is not the inadequacy of technology, or the lack of resources that present the last obstacle to fulfill the vision. The final roadblock concerns the existing property rights, inadequate for the new era, where the need for human labor is rapidly disappearing from the production processes.

1. Economic inequality

The World Economic Forum identified growing income inequality as one of the most pressing problems facing the world economy today, concerning not only the world economy, but the social order as well [14] [45]. The solutions of the problem presented to date have been primarily focused on redistribution of income or wealth through taxation [3], or policy changes [44][48], which for many reasons are encountering opposition. Analysis of the relation between worker motivation and income however sugest a new approach to the problem.

A recent work by DeVoe et all [30] shows, that income from labor - in addition to providing exchange value, is perceived by the rewarded workers as a measure of their competence. The authors show, that the intensity of workers' effort is driven not to capture maximum of the exchange value, but by desire to maximize the competence signal. Data from the real-world survey, as well as the laboratory experiments performed by the study authors also confirmed, that income from capital or other non-labor sources lacking the competence signaling function, do not have the motivational power of income from own work. Another evidence for importance of the competence signaling function comes from a study by Clark et all [52]. It confirms, that the exchange value of income is of secondary concern for workers, as they are willing to increase effort even for a lower (exchange) reward, if they can achieve higher rank in their peer group [51].

The model of worker motivation emerging from these and similar findigs presents a new kind of answer to the question of the origin of income inequality. In capitalist system, the competence signaling function of reward is inseparable from its exchange function and therefore any attempt to reward competence, necessarily grants the rewarded worker the exchange reward as well. However, DeVoe et all [30] found, that increases of the amount of the competence signal-containing reward make workers value the reward more, which leads them to step-up their work effort. The most rewared workers thus tend to acquire more reward, explaining the escalating flow of incomes into the top brackets of the pay distribution.

A solution to this problem is suggested by the different attitude of workers towards the two functions of remuneration. A new reward mechanism, where exchange value of reward is separated from the competence signaling measure should allow setting the measure as high as necessary, while keeping the exchange reward amount commensurable with the worker's actual effort. In such an arrangement, the likely principal reason driving accummulation of capital into an increasingly narrow segment of population would be eliminated, while keeping the motivational forces that give capitalism its dynamic character, intact.

A proposal to reward workers with non-exchangeable measure for competence is undoubtedly controversial. However, in addition to the above-cited research, another proof of viability of such a reward scheme can be seen in the existence of the volunteer "economy", where every year more than a billion people worldwide are willingly and regularly exchanging labor for pure competence-signaling reward. Lastly, in a world, where human physical attributes, or material possessions are for any reason unusable as carriers of  status or competence signals, new measures are needed to support our fundamental psychological and social needs [33]. For example on the internet, the problem of non-existent physicality [53] as a carrier of social signaling is being solved by emergence of a wide range of new measures not exchangeable for goods or services, like reputation rankings, facebook likes, badges, e.t.c..

2. Profit and reward

A hypotehtical economy, where the exchange and competence signaling functions are split into separate rewards can be modeled by analyzing two existing non-capitalist economic systems, which implement reward systems with only one of these functions.

The trillion dollars volunteer economy [2] is a system, where workers are rewarded for their labor with pure competence-signaling reward. The form of the reward varies for different types of services. For example, in the open source application development, competence might be signaled by the number of application installations, while in more traditional activities like community development work, volunteers are rewarded by gratitude expressed by the service recipients. In all cases, the size of the reward reflects utility of the created product or service rendered. The global presence of this economy and the signifficant value it generates every year should be seen as a testament to the power of pure competence reward.

Example of a system utilizing reward with only the exchange function is Timebanking [34] - a type of complementary currency - where one hour of work of any kind earns one time credit, exchangeable for an hour of another worker's work. For example, one hour of a doctor's work is considered equal in value to one hour of gardener's work. The model of worker motivation built upon the results of behavior research however predicts, that due to the absence of the competence signaling function in the reward, economies of this kind should not in general be viable in the long-term. A recent Timebanking study [35] confirms this prediction. It found an over time decreasing participation of timebank members, reluctance of higly-skilled members to trade their work for time credits and other issues. 

Yet, time-based remuneration is the base of not only alternative economic systems like Timebanking, but the mainstream ones as well. For example, the capitalist remuneration would not be different from Timebanking, if all of its economy actors had the same type and level of expertise. In that case, any differences in rewards recevied by different workers would be attributable exclusively to the amount of their effort, measured by the length of work time. Therefore in systems, where competence is rewarded separately, any type of work performed with the same effort (taking the same length of time) has equal exchange value.

These examples show, that a remuneration mechanism, that combines utility-based competence signaling reward with a separate time-based exchange reward, should - in the worker motivation domain - be equivalent to the capitalist system. It can be expected, that similar to the capitalist reward mechanism, also this new form of remuneration would motivate workers to maximize revenues from sales of the assets they make, as they are also the measure of utility of the asset, and therefore the workers' competence. The drive to maximize competence reward should lead to production of profit. That raises a question about who should be its recipient, as the workers in a dual-reward economy receive only exchange reward, equal to the number of their worked hours.

The answer to this question has two parts. The first can be found in the work of Sraffa [42], who has shown, that assets gain their distinctive form and function exclusively from labor - either direct, or indirect - "contained" in the factors of production used to make them. The direct labor can be measured directly by the work hours invested into making the assets. The source of indirect labor from the factors of production can be revealed by noticing, that the factors of production themselves are assets, which were in the past also made by labor and other factors of production. By applying recursion, a series of terms is produced, which represent labor contributions from all of the workers, whose work made the existence of the analyzed assets possible [43]. If human labor is considerd to be an instance of a larger class of matter-forming forces, the recursive procedure must include also terms from "work" of geological processes that created mineral deposits, the energy of the Sun that gives existence to forests or marine life, or the cosmological forces responsible for existence of our planetary system.

The second part of the answer concerns the fact, that according to the definition of the concept, profit was created by the work of workers from the series who have not yet been rewarded and by the unacounted-for energy that formed natural resources. The workers however can't be rewarded, as most of them have been dead for a long time and the natural processes do not have an owner. It is therefore reasonable to consider the exchange value of profit to be a part of cultural inheritance of mankind and distribute it equally among all people [54].

Such perspective however, clashes with our assumptions about property rights (and therefore also profit ownership). Those assumptions according to Eswaran and Neary [28] are part of an old survival mechanism, that evolved under competition for scarce resources, one of which is the right to own resources developed by own labor. In capitalism, this right is manifested by the appropriation of profits by the individual who produced them - either directly by own labor, or indirectly as the owner of capital. Our evolution-formed assumptions about individual property rights however loose their validity, when economic and social stability of whole groups of people is at stake. Various types of taxes levied on income and personal property by governments of all historic periods and economic systems are in a direct contradiction to our assumptions concerning ownership rights to the resources developed by own labor.

The profit ownership problem can be solved by changing our perspective on property rights, by considering the fact, that work reward caries two kinds of value. In such a model, the competence signaling measure of profit belongs fully to the worker, while the owner of its exchange value is the collective. This interpretation of property rights satisfies the research-identified human self-development needs and at the same time provides funding for equal and universal distribution scheme like basic income [9].

Description of NEO

In this section a framework of a new economic system (NEO) is presented, incorporating the remuneration and property rights ideas discussed in the previous section. The system assumes most of the institutions of the capitalist economic model, therefore only new rules and supporting concepts are described, followed by description of several typical scenarios. The goal is to provide just enough information to illustrate how the new rules could function in an economy. 

The infrastructure

In a departure from the capitalist system, which relies on its actors to know and follow the economy rules, in NEO these are encoded into a software aplication ("Rovas" [5]), as algorithmization and implementation of the economy rules into software eases participation in the economy for the economy actors and prevents rules violation as well. In addition to economy rules, Rovas also implements interfaces that allow the NEO participants to perform various tasks, like creating projects, entering work reports, paying for purchases, e.t.c. Interfaces are available also for enabling programmatic access to the Rovas-stored data and functions. To ensure robustness and uninterrupted availability of services and prevent the possibility of direct human intervention, the software is deployed on a global, distributed computing platform, consisting of networked computers (nodes) owned by the economy participants (built, or modeled upon [24] or [25]). From the governance point of view, development of the application follows the open source philosophy.

The economy actors

Any person wanting to participate in the NEO economy can create a Rovas account. The registration process - among other requirements - ensures, that the applicant has exactly one account. Biometric information is also collected, to support various usage scenarios where ease of use and/or security concerns need to be addressed (authentication, payments authorization...).

Chron - the NEO currency

Based on the consclusions made in the Discussion section, the NEO remuneration mechanism calls for existence of two types of rewards, with two corresponding measures. The carrier of exchange value is a new digital currency called "Chron," with one Chron equal to one hour of "average" work effort [26]. Chrons are created by Rovas, whenever a good or service is sold. At that moment new value is created in the economy, represented by the newly-issued Chrons. The amount of Chrons created generally equals to the revenues from sales, albeit a portion of the new Chrons are created in advance, as will be shown in the section describing the NEO economy rules.

The NEO currency stability is maintained by keeping supply of Chrons equal to the amount of value in the economy. This means, that as assets loose value over time, certain amount of Chrons must be removed from circulation. Measuring value loss is however practically impossible, therefore an indirect method is used. It is based on an assumption, that whenever a personal account is closed (for example due to the owner death), the "lifetime" economic value created by that person disappears from the economy. Considering, that the total economic value generated by an individual equals the number of the worker's competence signaling points (discussed in the next section) and Chrons are also issued for new value in the same amount as the competence signaling points, an amount of Chrons equal to the number of signaling points attached to a closed account is removed from circulation.

Merit - the competence measure

The size of a work reward, in addition being a determinand of the value the reward can be exchanged for, is perceived by its recipients also as signal of their competence. In the NEO reward mechanism, the competence signaling reward is given in a new measure, with units called "Merit". Like Chrons, Merits too are created when new value is created in the economy, therefore the amount of Chrons circulating in the economy is always equal to the number of Merits awarded to all NEO workers. Merits can't be gifted, or exchanged for goods or services, as they are a measure of workers' abilities. Merit scores of the economy participants are publicly accessible, alongside information about the assets, for whose values they were granted.

General NEO account

In addition to personal accounts, there is a special account in Rovas, used by the NEO rules for purposes that include temporary storage of Chrons before they are distributed to the economy actors, or storage of unclaimed Merits.

Remuneration rules in NEO

The rules described here assume a simple economy, where workers interact with Rovas directly, as individuals. It is expected, that rules governing activity of firms and other types of institutions will be derived from the basic principles of the NEO economy and the rules described in this section.

A note about transactions: NEO allows direct transactions between the economy actors using Chrons. In that scenario, none of the NEO rules are in effect and one of the consequences is, that no competence reward is awarded. In effect, the transacting parties are operating in a capitalist economy, using the NEO currency. To earn Merits, the economy participants must sell assets through Rovas-provided interfaces.

In NEO, workers are rewarded by Rovas with one Chron for every hour worked. In order to receive a payment, they must submit a report to Rovas, containing among other information the ID number of the project for which the work was performed and the number of hours worked. If the desired project has no record yet in Rovas (and therefore no project ID), the project owner must create it first, using the Rovas-provided interface. 

The revenues from sales of assets might fall into one of 3 ranges with different reward allocation rules. The range boundaries are:

A. no revenues
B. revenues equal to labor costs
C. revenues equal to labor costs plus the means of production costs
D. revenues exceeding costs

If the revenues are in the A-B range, Rovas creates new Chrons and an equal number of Merits for every hour reported. Chrons are deposited into the worker's account and an equal amount of Chrons is substracted from the general NEO account ballance (which can be negative). The Merits are also held in the general NEO account. To get the Merit reward, the worker must first sell the new asset, as the Merit reward is a measure of asset's utility, revealed when asset is sold. The Chrons received from sale of the asset are deposited into the general NEO account, to liquidate the debit caused by the advance payment of the exchange reward. At the same time, Merits equal to the sold asset's price is transferred from the general NEO account into the seller's account. 

It is apparent, that unlike in the capitalist economy, in NEO, exchange value reward is paid before value of the sold assets is determined. It is so, because in NEO all effort (labor time) is rewarded equally, regardless of the work output value. The value however determines the size of competence reward. Additional reasons why workers receive advance payment for their work are:

1. issuing exchange reward in advance solves a bootstrapping problem, most obvious when NEO economy is launched. At that moment, some workers might have created assets for sale, but as no Chrons exist yet, no one would be able to buy them.
2. work with no apparent use often plays positive role indirectly, for example as a source of (negative) experience other workers consider, when producing more successful work.
3. an asset may acquire value only after a signifficant delay, when the worker who created it can't be rewarded any more. 

The danger of damage to the economy caused by fraudulent work reporting can be limited by the following mechanisms:
a. Considering human biology constraints. The amount of work that is physically possible to perform during a given period is limited (humans can't work 24 hours a day 7 days a week...) and this constraint can be enforced in Rovas.
b. Services do not exist without customers, therefore paying service workers for their labor is conditioned on the existence of a sale event and at least one buyer.
c. Existence of a virtual good (software, media...) can be verified by Rovas by direct inquiry, as this type of assets must have built-in code for collecting payments and usage information. The nascent internet of things will enable connections to Rovas also for physical goods, making verification of their existence possible.
d. The most effective defense will likely come from the fact, that non-existent work output does not generate any competence reward.
e. False work reporting can be made illegal and punishable. Various enforcement scenarios are imaginable, including community-based ones.

For revenues that exceed the labor costs, but are less or equal to the sum of all input costs, NEO has different reimbursement rules depending on the origin
of the means of production used. While the cost of the means of production originating in NEO (that have NEO project ID) is reimbursed to the direct workers, they receive no Merits for the value attributable to the means of production. Instead, the Merits are paid to the (indirect) workers who created the means of production. For means of production not made in NEO, their share of Merits is held in the general NEO account, as the true recipient is unknown.
Those Merits are periodically liquidated at a rate equal to the rate at which the economy assets loose value.

Lastly, if the revenues from sales exceed all input costs, Rovas generates Merits and Chrons in the amount equal to the profit and distributes them accoring to these rules:

1. Merits are divided between the direct workers and the creators of the means of production used to make the sold asset. The share that each of these groups receive is proportional to their share of input costs. Thus, for example the direct workers receive:

MeritsW = Lc / MPc

...and the means of production creators receive:

MeritsMP = MPc / Lc

where:
MeritsW - Number of Merits paid to workes who provided direct labor
MeritsMP - Number of Merits paid to workes who created the means of production
MPc - the means of production costs
Lc - the direct labor costs

When purchasing an asset for use as means of production, the buyer can agree with the seller to share any future potential competence reward using other than the default credit allocation. If this is the case, the sales record for the sold asset must contain information about the agreed-upon share.
If the means of production creators can't be identified, their share of Merits is again deposited into the general NEO account and over time liquidated as mentioned above.

2. Chrons are deposited into the general NEO account, where they are used to liquidate any advances paid to workers, whose output did not generate enough sales to cover their labor costs. Any remaining Chrons are periodically distributed equally among all NEO participants as a Universal Dividend.





The following example illustrates the basic concepts and functions of NEO.

Example 1: An entrepreneur creating a web application.

An entrepreneur starts work by creating a new project in Rovas, providing information like name of the project, its description, e.t.c.. Upon submitting, Rovas will generate unique project ID and associates it with the entrepreneur's ID. As she works on the project, the entrepreneur may record her work time, or do so upon reaching some of the project's milestone. If third party tools are needed, she will purchase them and record their Rovas asset IDs (a kind of project ID). Tools without ID do not have to be recorded - they have either been purchased outside of NEO and therefore are not paid with Chrons or the entrepreneur decided not to report such asset use.

In order to record sales, the entrepreneur will embed speciel code into the web application, connecting it into Rovas. This will allow automatic processing of payments received from users, or record information about usage of the web application. Lastly, the entrepreneur or another worker charged with selling the web application will have to choose a suitable monetizing strategy. Any of the strategies common in the capitalist economy can be used.

For example, in a scenario where access is allowed only to authenticated users who pay a set price, the buyer authenticates into Rovas[20] and confirms payment. The web application will send a transaction into Rovas containing ID of the buyer, together with project ID. The Chrons from buyer's account (managed by Rovas) are transferred into NEO common account and the buyer is granted access into application. 

Rovas will add together all payments received from all buyers and substract them from all costs. Every Chron earned will get divided among workers involved in the asset production lifecycle (conception, design... sales, delivery) according to the number of work hours invested into creating the asset. To account for differences in the amount of training or education, better trained workers will be able to claim portion of their training costs as an expense and get paid more. Education and training expenses in NEO are considered to be costs. The exact amount of such costs will probably have to be negotiated among the worker and the project owner, as the amount of specialised expertise provided by training will vary with the type of task performed.

All workers will also receive Merits for their work. The Merit reward will consist of two parts:

1. the base component, numerically equal to the worker's Chron reward
2. the negotiable component, reflecting a concrete worker's contribution to the market success of the good or service produced. As we presently do not know how to measure individual intellectual contributions to products developed collectively, each worker's share of the total Merit reward will have to be negotiated among the workers.

Total Merit reward for a concrete worker:

Mw = Mbi + P*Ii

Mbi - the base Merit reward amount. It is equal to the number of Chrons earned by the rewarded worker
P - profit, equal to total revenue minus costs
Ii - the contribution of the rewarded worker to the asset's market success. The concrete amount (from interval 0 - 1) will likely have to be negotiated by the workers. There could be a default value for this parameter in Rovas, derived from the Mbi, by formula:

Iid = CHw/CHt

CHw - the number of Chrons earned by the worker
CHt - revenue (the total number of Chrons earned from asset sales)

As Mbi = CHw, and CHt = R (revenue), the final Merit reward would be calculated by:

Mw = CHw + P*CHw/R = CHw*(1 + P/R)


All workers participating on the production will start receive (Chron) payments as soon as first web application users (buyers) start paying for access. After all production costs are paid, profit is stored in Rovas and earmarked for Universal distribution.



Generic example:

A worker creates a good and registers (say) 10 work hours into Rovas. Rovas creates 10 Chrons and sends them to the worker. 
a. If the good does not sell, 10 Chrons must be liquidated at the first opportunity - from profits generated by sales of other workers' assets. The NEO economy is subsidizing the loss in full.
b. If the good sells and the sale price is less that 10 Chrons - for, example - 4 Chrons, then the NEO economy loss is lowered to 6 Chrons. 
c. If the sale price is exactly 10 Chrons, the advance paid to the worker is completely repaid.
d. If profit is made by selling the good (say 10 Chrons from the sale price of 20 Chrons), then not only is the advance liquidated, but Rovas mints additional 10 Chrons. NEO uses this value to liquidate other advances, or for funding Universal distribution.
The worker receives Merit points only when the good is sold:
case b.: 4 Merit points
case c.: 10 Merit points
case d.: 20 Merit points

The situation is similar when seling services. The main difference between seling goods and services is, that services are created at the moment they get consumed. Therefore by definition, services have always value, because if a service does not find any customers, it does not exist. A good can be made but nobody finds it useful and therefore such a good has no value

 therefore  Sale price however can be lower, equal or greater than inputs:

a. sale price lower than the cost of inputs. Situation is equal to case "b" above.
b. sale price equals the cost of inputs. Situation is equal to case "c" above.
c. sale price exceeds the cost of inputs. Situation is equal to case "d" above.

NEO and the existing (outside) economy

Considering, that the proposed economic model will coexist with the outside economy for some time, some rules will need to be implemented, governing transfer of value between the outside economy and NEO.

1. At some point after NEO becomes operational, Chrons will be made available on currency markets to allow conversions to foreign currencies to allow NEO participants acquire goods from the "outside" economies and vice-versa, outside companies to buy goods traded in Chrons. It is hard to predict the exchange rate, but given that Chron is going to be always equal to one hour of human labor, its price should relatively quickly rise to at least the world average of minimum hourly wage. Due to the fact that price of human labor will be higher in NEO than the same amount of labor in local currencies of most of the world's poorest countries, economic benefits of NEO will first be manifested on mass scale in those countries.

2. Governments and individual donors will be encouraged to donate money to Neo. Such money will be used to buy Chrons in exchanges (making exchange rates more favorable to Chron holders) and subsequently distribute them as Universal Distribution to the NEO participants.

3. To provide incentive for people from outside economies to purchase Chrons, it should be possible also to buy Merits. The reason is, that money earned in the capitalist economy represent a mixture of effort and impact rewards and thus people should receive for their foreign currency not only Chrons, but also Merits. The procedure would involve exchanging foreign currency into Chrons first and then buying Merits using the - at the time current - Chron to Merit ratio of the NEO economy. It can be expected, that there will always be much more Chrons generated in a given period that Merits, therefore also the ratio will be quite small. It might mean that for 10 000 Chrons it would be possible to get only couple of Merits. 
Option to buy Merits should have double impact - allow rich foreign currency holders to receive some Merits for their money and at the same time not provide much incentives to NEO workers to buy Merits with their Chrons, because Merits should be generally non-tradeable. The most important part is, that interest in Chrons should improve exchange rate, which should further increase participation in the NEO economy.

Conclusion

According to Self-Determination Theory [http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/theory/]

"...Conditions supporting the individualâ€™s experience of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are argued to foster the most volitional and high quality forms of motivation and engagement for activities, including enhanced performance, persistence, and creativity. In addition SDT proposes that the degree to which any of these three psychological needs is unsupported or thwarted within a social context will have a robust detrimental impact on wellness in that setting..."



Appendix

but this choice will lower the amount of Universal distribution the buyer will receive from NEO (mecahnism to be described later). A score derived from the average price paid by buyers of pay-as-you-wish assets and the price paid by a particular buyer will be visible to all users in order to promote pro-social behavior.

The third scenario, where anonymous users are allowed access to assets will likely be used only during transition period from capitalist to the NEO economy. It is envisioned, that in this case assets creators will not receive any Merits, but will be paid for at least a portion of their costs from funds received from sources like government subsidies wishing to promote employment and from charitable donations who accummuated wealth in the capitalist economies. Rules for these transactions will have to be developed.

Separating competence and exchange functions will likely have a side effect of killing attractiveness of inheritance, because the recipient will receive no (coveted) merits. The exchange value gained will be useless in NEO.


Suppose the entrepreneur invested 1000 hours into creating the web application (asset 1) and paid 10 chrons to acquire asset 2 (for example a program with specific functionality, that is needed in the web application). The total cost of web application is then 1010 chrons. Let's further assume, that the consumers collectively paid 2000 chrons for accessing the web application.

The rewards will be shared between the asset 1 and asset 2 creators in the following way:

â€¢ Asset 1 creator (our entrepreneur) will receive 1000 chrons
â€¢ Asset 2 creator will receive 10 chrons
â€¢ Contribution to the Neo common account will be 990 chrons

â€¢ Asset 1 creator will receive (1000/1010)*990 = 980 merits
â€¢ Asset 2 creator will receive (10/1010)*990 = 10 merits


The amount of merits the asset creator receives will be calculated dynamically, as it depends on the number of purchases. Our entrepreneur would see her merit score grow with each new paying consumer. An important feaure of NEO is propagation of merit, which means that also creators of the assets used to create the web application would receive portion of merits - as shown above.

From the consumer point of view, upon arriving to the web application, they will be prompted to log in with their NEO account credentials. After successful login, one of these two scenarios would play out:

1. the entrepreneur specified "pay as much as you want" option in the Minimum price field. The consumer could make the voluntary payment at the time when accessing the web application, or continue without paying. Once a month the consumer will receive a NEO usage statement, listing all assets the account holder consumed but not paid for yet, that were priced with "pay as much as you want" value in the Minimum price field. The consumer could choose to pay individually for every asset, or specify one amount for all unpaid items, leaving it up to Rovas to distribute the payments.

2. The consumer would be prompted on the web application to pay for access by paying the Minimum price.

The above is an example from the digital domain. In the physical domain, an asset creator would have to contend with issues like how to control access to an asset (a lecture, use of skating ring, entry into an event,), or how to register (identify and count) NEO consumers. Given the dramatic technological developments we see on a daily basis, associated with quickly decreasing costs of electronics of all kinds, it can be expected that inexpensive devices capable of scanning NEO consumer's IDs (biometric, wearable devices, e.t.c.) powered by ambient energy sources and connected to an ubiquitous network will soon make connection between the physical and digital domains possible and affordable.

[26] To avoid confusion caused by differences in work effort among different workers and occupations, one Chron could be defined as a set amount of energy, for example, 500 kjoules per hour - the exact number is not critical. In fact, the common, intuitive understanding of normal work effort will suffice as a reference point for "average work effort".

[43] A likely to be misunderstood factors of production are knowledge and talent, possession of which allows workers to perform a given task faster/better, than less gifted workers. As a consequence, more knowledgeable workers are more productive and argument could be made, that they deserve larger exchange reward. However, knowledge employed in the production process has attributes and the effects of a physical tool - it increases labor productivity and workers must make an investment in order to acquire it. That makes knowledge indistinguishable from other factors of production. Thus also expenses  related to knowledge acquisition (tuition, cost of own study time..) can enter into profit calculation as a cost.
Talent and similar forms of creativity are not the results of the endowed individual's effort. Instead, their existence is caused by random processes, occurrence rate of which increases with the size of human population. Talent is instance of a quality, whose values for different individuals can be placed on a scale, measuring their effect on the usefulness for society from "detrimental" to "positive". Considering, that society carries the burden of care for the individuals (and their actions) from the negative part of the spectrum, society should also be the benefactor of the positive contributions made by the talented individuals. Thus talent should not be a factor affecting the amount of exchange reward of an individual worker.

[51] From the human psychology point of view, coupling between motivation and the signaling aspect of labor income is in agreement with the Self-determination theory, [33] according to which, competence is one of three fundamental human needs (the other two being authonomy and relatedness), necessary for the experience of a fulfilling and meaningful life.
