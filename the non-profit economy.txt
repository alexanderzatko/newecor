The merit economy

"..Now it is true that the needs of human beings may seem to be insatiable. But they fall into two classes – those needs which are absolute in the sense that we feel them whatever the situation of our fellow human beings may be, and those which are relative in the sense that we feel them only if their satisfaction lifts us above, makes us feel superior to, our fellows. Needs of the second class, those which satisfy the desire for superiority, may indeed be insatiable; for the higher the general level, the higher still are they. But this is not so true of the absolute needs - a point may soon be reached, much sooner perhaps than we are all of us aware of, when these needs are satisfied in the sense that we prefer to devote our further energies to non-economic purposes..."

John M. Keynes, Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren


Introduction

--outline--
1. the dual character of remuneration
2. the new perspective on the ownership rights concerning exchange value of profits
3. proposal for a new economic system implementing the new remuneration mechanism

The presented paper presents a new remuneration mechanism that separates the competence and exchange functions of capitalist reward system into two separate measures

Discussion

In 1930, in his essay "Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren" John M. Keynes [37] described a vision of the world economy "hundred years hence", where most labor is done by machines, the economic problem solved and human interests focused to "live wisely and agreeably and well". Fifteen years remain to the onset of the hypothetical new era and due to the rapid advances in technology, the vision no longer seems unattainable. It is becoming clear, that it is not the inadequacy of technology, or the lack of resources that present the last obstacle to fulfill the vision. The final roadblock concerns the existing property rights, inadequate for an era, where the need for human labor is rapidly disappearing from the production processes.

1. Economic inequality

The World Economic Forum identified growing income inequality as one of the most pressing problems facing the world economy today, concerning not only the world economy, but the social order as well [14] [45]. The solutions of the problem presented to date have been primarily focused on redistribution of income or wealth through taxation [3], or policy changes [44][48], which for many reasons are encountering opposition. Analysis of the relation between worker motivation and income however sugest a new approach to the problem.

A recent work by DeVoe et al. [30] shows, that income from labor - in addition to providing exchange value, is perceived by the rewarded workers as a measure of their competence. The authors show, that the intensity of work effort is driven by desire to maximize the competence signal, not to capture maximum of the exchange value. Data from a real-world survey, as well as laboratory experiments performed by the authors also confirmed, that income from capital, or other non-labor sources that lack the competence signaling component, do not have the motivational power of income from own work. Another evidence of importance of the competence signaling function comes from a study by Clark et al. [52]. It confirms, that the exchange value of income is of secondary concern for workers, as they are willing to increase effort even for a lower (exchange) reward, if they can achieve higher rank in their peer group [51].

The model of worker motivation emerging from these and similar findigs presents a new kind of answer to the question of the origin of income inequality. In capitalist system, the competence signaling function of reward is inseparable from its exchange function and therefore any attempt to reward competence, necessarily grants the rewarded worker the exchange reward as well. However, DeVoe et al. [30] found, that increases of the amount of the competence signal-containing reward make workers value the reward more, which leads them to step-up their work effort. The most rewared workers thus tend to acquire more reward, explaining the escalating flow of incomes into the top brackets of the pay distribution.

A solution to this problem is suggested by the different attitude of workers towards the two functions of remuneration. A new reward mechanism, where exchange value of reward is separated from the competence signaling measure would allow setting the measure as high as necessary, while keeping the exchange reward amount commensurable with the worker's actual effort. In such an arrangement, the likely principal reason driving accummulation of capital into an increasingly narrow segment of population would be eliminated, while keeping the motivational forces that give capitalism its dynamic character, intact.

A proposal to reward workers with non-exchangeable measure for competence is undoubtedly controversial. However, in addition to the above-cited research, another proof of viability of such a reward scheme is confirmed by existence of the volunteer economy, where every year more than a billion people worldwide [2] are willingly exchanging labor for pure competence-signaling reward. Lastly, in a world, where human physical attributes, or material possessions are for any reason unusable as carriers of  status or competence signals, new measures are needed to satisfy our fundamental psychological and social needs [33]. For example on the internet, the problem of non-existent physicality [53] as a carrier of social signaling gave rise to a wide range of new measures not exchangeable for goods or services, like reputation rankings [64], facebook likes, mozilla badges [63], e.t.c..

2. Profit and reward

A hypotehtical economy, where the exchange and competence signaling functions exist separately can be studied by analyzing two existing economic systems, that implement reward systems with only one of these functions.

The trillion dollars volunteer economy [2] is a system, where workers are rewarded for their labor with a pure competence-signaling reward. The form of the reward varies for different types of services. For example, in the open source application development, competence might be signaled by the number of application installations, while in more traditional activities like community development work, volunteers are rewarded by gratitude expressed by the service recipients. In all cases, the size of the reward reflects utility of the created product or service rendered. The global presence of this economy and the signifficant value it generates every year should be seen as a testament to the power of pure competence reward.

Example of a system with reward having only the exchange value function is Timebanking [34] - a type of complementary currency - where one hour of work of any kind earns one time credit, exchangeable for an hour of another worker's work. For example, one hour of a doctor's work is considered equal in value to one hour of gardener's work. The model of worker motivation built upon the results of behavior research however predicts, that due to the absence of the competence signaling function in the reward, economies of this kind should not be viable in the long-term. A Timebanking study by Shih et al. [35] confirms this prediction. It found an over time decreasing participation of timebank members, reluctance of higly-skilled members to trade their work for time credits and other issues. 

Yet, time-based remuneration is the base of not only alternative economic systems like Timebanking, but in certain contexts of the mainstream ones as well. For example, the capitalist remuneration is not different from Timebanking, when workers have the same type and level of expertise. In that case, any differences in the rewards recevied by different workers are attributable exclusively to the amount of their effort, measured by the length of work time. Therefore in systems, where competence is rewarded separately, any type of work performed with the same effort (taking the same length of time) has equal exchange value.

These examples show, that a remuneration mechanism, that combines utility-based competence signaling reward with a separate time-based exchange reward, should - in the worker motivation domain - be equivalent to the capitalist system. It can be expected, that similar to the capitalist reward mechanism, also this new form of remuneration would motivate workers to maximize revenues from sales of the assets they make, as they are also the measure of utility of the asset, and therefore the workers' competence. The drive to maximize competence reward should lead to surplus value. That raises a question, about who should be recipient of the exchange value of profit, as the workers in a dual-reward economy only receive exchange reward equal to the number of their worked hours.

The answer to this question has two parts. The first can be found in the work of Sraffa [42], who has shown, that assets gain their distinctive form and function exclusively from labor - either directly measurable by the number of worked hours, or indirect - "contained" in the factors of production used to make the assets. The source of indirect labor from the factors of production can be revealed by noticing, that the factors of production themselves are assets, that were in the past also made by labor and other factors of production. By applying recursion, a series of terms is produced, which represent labor contributions from all of the workers, whose work made the existence of the analyzed assets possible [43]. If human labor is considerd to be instance of a larger class of matter-forming forces, the recursive procedure must include also terms from "work" of geological processes that created mineral deposits, the energy of the Sun that gives existence to forests or marine life, or the cosmological forces responsible for existence of our planetary system.

The second part of the answer concerns the fact, that according to the definition of the concept, profit was created by the work of workers from the series, who have not been rewarded and by the unacounted-for natural resources-forming energy. Those workers however can't be rewarded, as most of them have been dead for a long time and the natural processes do not have an owner. It is therefore reasonable to consider the exchange value of profit to be a part of cultural inheritance of mankind, to be distributed equally among all people [54].

Such perspective however, clashes with our assumptions about property rights (and therefore also profit ownership). Those assumptions according to Eswaran and Neary [28] are part of an old survival mechanism, which evolved under competition for scarce resources, one of which is the right to own resources developed by own labor. In capitalism, this right is manifested by the appropriation of profits by the individuals who produced them - either directly by own labor, or indirectly as owners of capital. Our evolution-formed assumptions about individual property rights however lose their validity, when economic and social stability of whole groups of people is at stake. Various types of taxes levied on income and personal property by governments of all historic periods and economic systems are in a direct contradiction to our assumptions about ownership rights to value developed by own labor.

The profit ownership problem can be solved by a new model of property rights that accounts for the fact, that work reward provides its recipients with two kinds of values. The competence signaling measure of profit (its numerical value) should belong to the workers who created it, while its exchange value should be distributed among all people. This interpretation of property rights addresses the research-identified source of worker motivation and at the same time provides funding for an equal and universal distribution scheme like basic income [9].

Description of NEO

In this section a framework of a new economic system (NEO) is presented, incorporating the remuneration and property rights ideas discussed in the preceding section. The system assumes most of the institutions of the capitalist system, therefore only new rules and supporting concepts are described, followed by description of several typical scenarios. The goal is to provide just enough information to illustrate how the new rules could function in an economy. 

The infrastructure

In a departure from the capitalist system, which relies on its actors to know and follow the economy rules, in NEO these are encoded into a software aplication ("Rovas" [5]). In addition to the economy rules, Rovas also implements interfaces that allow the NEO participants to perform tasks like creating projects, entering work reports, paying for purchases, e.t.c. Interfaces are available also to facilitate programmatic access to the Rovas-stored data and functions. To ensure robustness and uninterrupted availability of services and prevent the possibility of direct human intervention, the software is deployed on a global, distributed computing platform, consisting of networked computers (nodes) owned by the economy participants (built, or modeled upon [24] or [25]). As a consequence, personal data is owned by the economy participants and no actor has privileged access to the system. From the governance point of view, development of the application follows the open source philosophy.

The economy actors

Any person wanting to participate in NEO can create a Rovas account. The registration process - among other requirements - ensures, that the applicant has exactly one account. Biometric information is also collected, to support various usage scenarios where ease of use and/or security concerns need to be addressed (authentication, payments authorization...).

Chron - the NEO currency

Based on the consclusions made in the Discussion section, the NEO remuneration mechanism calls for existence of two types of rewards, with two corresponding measures. The carrier of exchange value is a new digital currency called "Chron," with ten Chrons equal to one hour of "average" work effort [26]. Chrons are created by Rovas, whenever a good or service is sold, as at that moment new value is created in the economy. The amount of Chrons created is in general equal to the revenues from sales, albeit a portion of the new Chrons is created in advance, as will be shown in the section describing the NEO economy rules.

The NEO currency stability is maintained by keeping supply of Chrons equal to the amount of value in the economy. This means, that as assets loose value over time, certain amount of Chrons must be removed from circulation. Measuring value loss is however practically impossible, therefore an indirect method is used. It is based on an assumption, that whenever a personal account is closed (for example due to the owner death), the lifetime economic value created by that person disappears from the economy. Considering, that the total economic value generated by an individual equals the number of the worker's competence signaling points (discussed in the next section) and Chrons are also issued for new value in the same amount as the competence signaling points, an amount of Chrons equal to the number of signaling points attached to a closed account is removed from circulation.

Merit - the competence measure

The size of work reward, in addition to being the determinant of the value the reward can be exchanged for, is perceived by its recipients also as signal of their competence. In the NEO reward mechanism, the competence signaling reward is expressed by a new measure, with units called "Merit". Like Chrons, new Merits also are issued when new value is created in the economy, in an amount numerically equal to the created value. Therefore the amount of Chrons in circulation is always equal to the number of Merits awarded to all NEO workers. Merits can't be gifted or exchanged for goods or services, as they are a measure of individual worker's abilities. Merit scores of the economy participants are publicly accessible, alongside the information about the assets, for which they were granted.

General NEO account

In addition to accounts held by the economy participants, a special account exists in Rovas, used by the NEO rules for purposes, which include temporary storage of Chrons before they are distributed to the economy actors, or to store Merits that can't be assigned to a NEO participant.

Remuneration rules in NEO

The rules described here assume a simple economy, where workers interact with Rovas directly, as individuals. It is expected, that rules governing activity of firms and other types of institutions will be derived from the basic principles of the NEO economy and the rules described in this section.

It should also be noted, that NEO allows direct transactions between the economy actors using Chrons. In that scenario, none of the NEO rules are in effect and one of the consequences is, that no competence reward is awarded. In effect, the transacting parties are operating in a capitalist economy, using the NEO currency. To earn Merits, the economy participants must sell assets through Rovas-provided interfaces.

In NEO, workers are rewarded by Rovas with 10 Chrons for every hour worked. In order to receive a payment for their labor and the means of production they used while making the asset, they must submit a report to Rovas, containing among other information the ID number of the project for which the work was performed, along with the number of hours worked. If the desired project has no record yet in Rovas (and therefore no project ID), the project owner must create it first, using the Rovas-provided interface. 

The revenues from sales of assets might fall into one of 3 ranges with different reward allocation rules. The ranges boundaries are:

A. no revenues
B. revenues equal to labor costs
C. revenues equal to labor costs plus the means of production costs
D. revenues exceeding all costs

Range 1 - the revenues do not exceed the labor costs

If workers are interested in advance payment for their work, they can send a work report as described above and fulfill one additinal requirement - to pass the "number of worked hours check". The number of worked hours check is performed by Rovas, by calculating the average number of hours per day for the reported period. If the calculated number is smaller than 8 hours on average (more for shorter periods and less for longer periods), the test is considered passed. Once the test is completed, Rovas creates new Chrons and an equal number of Merits for the labor time the asset creator reported. The Chrons are deposited into that worker's account and an equal amount of Chrons is substracted from the general NEO account ballance. The new Merits are held in the general NEO account until the worker sells the new asset. Only then the value of the asset's utility is revealed and the Merits can be transferred into the worker's account. Chrons received from the asset sale are deposited into the general NEO account, where they are used to liquidate the debit caused by the advance payment.

The need for paying workers in advance is a consequence of one of the fundamental principles of the NEO economy - the separation of exchange and competence signaing rewards - which dictates, that all effort (labor time) must be rewarded equally, regardless of the work output value. Additional reasons why workers receive the advance payment for their work are:

1. issuing exchange reward in advance solves a bootstrapping problem, most apparent when NEO economy is launched. At that moment, no assets could be purchased, as no Chrons exist yet.
2. work output without value (one that does not sell) often plays positive role indirectly, for example as a source of (negative) experience other workers consider, when producing more successful work.
3. an asset may acquire value only after a signifficant delay, when the worker who created it can't be rewarded any more. 


Range 2

For revenues that are equal to, or exceed the labor costs, but are less than the sum of all input costs, NEO has different reimbursement rules, that depend on the origin of the means of production used. While the cost of the means of production originating in NEO (ones that have the NEO project ID) is reimbursed to the asset-producing workers, they receive no Merits for the new value created by the asset sale, attributable to the means of production. Instead, those Merits are paid to the (indirect) workers who created the means of production (assets). For means of production not made in NEO, the newly-created Merits are held in the general NEO account, as their creators are unknown. Those Merits are periodically liquidated at a rate equal to the rate at which the economy assets loose value.

Range 3

Lastly, if the revenues from sales exceed all input costs, Rovas generates Merits and Chrons in the amount equal to the profit and distributes them accoring to these rules:

1. Merits are divided between the direct workers and the creators of the means of production used to make the sold asset. The share that each of these groups receive is by default proportional to their share of the input costs. Thus, for example the direct workers receive:

MeritsW = P * (Lc / (MPc+Lc))

...and the means of production creators receive:

MeritsMP = P * (MPc / (MPc+Lc))

where:
MeritsW - Number of Merits paid to workes who provided direct labor
MeritsMP - Number of Merits paid to workes who created the means of production
P - The value generated by the asset sale (equal to profit)
Lc - the direct labor costs
MPc - the means of production costs

When purchasing an asset to be used as a means of production, the buyer can agree to share any future potential competence reward with the seller, using other than the default - based on the sale price - credit allocation. If this is the case, the sales record for the sold asset must contain information about the agreed-upon Merit-distribution function.

If the means of production creators can't be identified, their share of Merits is again deposited into the general NEO account and over time liquidated as mentioned above.

2. Chrons from profits are deposited into the general NEO account, where they are used to cancel any debits from advances paid to workers. Any remaining Chrons are periodically and equally distributed among all NEO participants as the Universal Distribution.

The following examples illustrate the basic concepts and functions of NEO.

Example 1: An entrepreneur creating a web application.

An entrepreneur starts work by creating new project in Rovas, by providing information like the name of the project, description and the choice of monetizing model. Upon submitting, Rovas generates unique project (asset) ID and associates it with the entrepreneur's ID. As she works on the project, the entrepreneur may record her work time, or do so upon reaching arbitrary milestones. Recording work time is not necessary, if she is interested only in the competence reward - as is the case with volunteer projects. If third party tools are needed, she will purchase them and record their asset IDs together with the portion of their value used in production. For means of production made outside the NEO economy, the entrepreneur will record only the portion of their value used up in creating the web application.

In order to record sales, the entrepreneur will embed special code into the web application, allowing Rovas to process payments received from users. When ready to start selling, the entrepreneur changes the project status in Rovas to reflect that fact. If our entrepreneur wants to receive the advance payment for her work hours, she will indicate so in the project record. Rovas then checks if the number of work hours reported for the reported time period is realistic - not violating constraints dictated by human physiology. If that step is successful, Chrons for labor are created and deposited into the entrepreneur's account.

To sell her product, any of the strategies common in the capitalist economy can be used. For example, in a "paywall" scenario, the buyer will authenticate into Rovas [20] and confirm the payment. The web application will send a transaction into Rovas containing ID of the buyer, together with project ID. The Chrons from the buyer's account (managed by Rovas) get transferred into the general NEO account and the buyer will gain access into the application.

To provide a more concrete picture of the rewards distribution, let's suppose the entrepreneur invested 100 hours of labor into creating the web application, which is equivalent to 1,000 Chrons. The entrepreneur also paid 100 Chrons for a program module with a specific functionality, needed in the web application. The total cost of web application is then 1,100 Chrons. Let's further assume, that the buyers collectively paid 20,000 Chrons for accessing the web application. Rovas distributes the rewards in the following way:

• the entrepreneur will receive 1,000 Chrons as an advance payment and once the web application generates enough sales, also the 100 Chrons to cover the cost of the software module. She will also receive 20,000 - 100 = 19,900 Merits as the competence reward.
• the software module creator will receive the remaining 100 Merits, which is the default competence signaling reward distribution, calculated from the input costs. If the module creator and the web application developer would have negotiated different distribution of Merits, that agreed-upon formula would be used instead.
• The general NEO account will be credited with 20,000 Chrons from which 1,000 will be used to cancel the advance payment made to our entrepreneur and 100 Chrons will be transfered to her personal account to cover the software module cost. The remaining 18,900 Chrons will be used to cancel any advances made to other NEO workers and the rest will be divided among the economy participants in ther form of the Universal Distribution.

If the entrepreneur would have choosen a "pay as much as you want" payment model, the web application visitor/consumer could either make a voluntary payment immediately within the application, or use it without paying. In that case, NEO will send notification to the consumers about availability of a new usage statement. The statement - acessible in the Rovas application - will contain listing of all assets sold under the "pay as much as you want" payment model, that the account holder had consumed but not paid for. The consumer could choose to pay separately for every good or service listed, or specify an arbitrarily high amount for all unpaid items, leaving it up to Rovas to distribute the payments.


Example 2: A team of workers creating physical goods

A company owned and run by Jane, Mary and Bill produces sandwiches and resells them through a network of merchants. When starting the business, they made an agreement, to divide any competence reward from sales to 5 parts, with Bill receiving one and Jane and Mary 2 parts each, to reflect their individual value contributions. With the help of technology, they make 100 sandwiches in 1 hour, from 20 Chrons worth of ingredients. Other costs (amortization of machines, electricity...) contribute 0.1 Chron per sandwich. The total input costs per sandwich is 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.6 Chrons. The average sandwich price to the merchants is 1.5 Chrons. The company software sends periodically accounting information into Rovas, which issues Chron and Merit rewards to the workers' accounts. For one 8-hour day each of them earns 80 Chrons for labor and the total 1,200  Merits from the sale of the 800 sandwiches get divided among the workers according to the agreed-upon formula: 240 Merits for Bill and 480 Merits for Jane and Mary each. From the sales revenues, Rovas deposits 240 Chrons a day into the company account to reimburse the non-labor costs. The 720 Chrons remaining is deposited into the general NEO account. 

In this scenario, the workers would opt out from receiving advance payments, as sales and therefore the full work reward distributions are made every day.

It should also be noted, that in a marked departure from the capitalist model, the firm does not receive the exchange value component of profits, that in capitalism is often used to fund future business plans. In NEO, capital for business investments must be acquired from company employees individually or from outside investors as profits belong to all NEO participants.

Example 3: Investing Chrons to earn Merits

This last example illustrates how the NEO participants can use their extra Chrons to increase their Merit score. This is possible to do, by investing into businesses, in exchange for a share of equity. However, unlike in the capitalist system, where gains from such investments combine exchange as well as competence signaling functions, in NEO, the investors receive only competence reward. The exact portion of Merits received is determined by negotiations between the investors and the entrepreneurs and the resulting agreed-upon distribution formula is used by Rovas to allocate the competence reward. The exchange value of profits is deposited into the general NEO account. 

Investing Chrons to gain Merits does not violate the principle of non-tradability of Merits, as the Chron holders must use their market knowledge to identify potentially successful enterprises, thus contesting their competence. Investing caries a real possibility of losing the investments, therefore investors are not simply buying Merits. For the same reason, currency arbitrage involving that might lead to profit generation, is not violating any NEO principles.

Conclusion

To date, none of the historical proposals (for example [54], [58], socialism), aimed at addressing the problems of capitalism [59] have been succesful. It is therefore not unreasonable to question viability of the economic model, presented in this paper. Particularly problematic might be perceived the challenges, the new economy presents to the traditional assumptions about property rights, and to the established remuneration mechanism. While only an actual implementation of NEO can ultimately determine validity of these concerns, there are arguments for why the two founding principles of the new economy might not be a barrier to its adoption.

It can be expected, that NEO will be first adopted by the same people, who today generate value in the world 7th largest - volunteer economy [2]. By merely registering their projects in NEO and presenting them to their consumers as such, volunteers can receive not only an explicit (Merit) reward for their social contribution, but also potentially generate sales that would fund their General Distribution payment. The amount of those payments would apparently depend on the willingness of buyers to pay for the volunteer-made assets, but pricing strategies exist, suitable for this scenario. For example, the "pay what you want" (PWYW) strategy might be a particularly good candidate, as it allows continued free access to the volunteer-made goods or services, while providing them with an option to purchase the assets. Gneezy et al. have shown, [57] that the PWYW payment strategy generates signifficantly more revenues than fixed pricing strategy, when part of the proceeds from sales were promised to be given to a charity. Considering the overall pro-sociall and wealth-sharing character of NEO, a similar behavioral response can be expected also when using this payment strategy for volunteer-produced goods and services.

Another segment of population unlikely to be deterred by the NEO unorthodox rules are the world poorest people. NEO offers everybody access to the Universal Distribution payments as well as the possibility to earn Chrons for own work. The possibility to receive money for work on projects of one's own design makes it likely, that more often that not people will choose to produce assets beneficial to the society. Wealthy donors and governments, searching for the most effective way to maximize the impact of their resources, might find this job-creating aspect especially attractive and support it by donating to NEO. The resources would be exchanged on the foreign exchange markets for Chrons, which in turn would be used to liquidate any potential debits created by the advance reward payments [60]. 

It can be expected, that the value of Chrons on the foreign exchange market will be initially low, allowing even small donations made in non-NEO currencies to buy large amounts of the NEO currency. The workers would use their Chrons to buy goods or services in the NEO economy, or - after converting Chrons on the foreign exchange markers - in the non-NEO economies [56]. It is apparent, that to make this scenario a reality, the economic actors must have access to the internet and access to a computing device. This requirement will likely be addressed in the near future, as there is a concentrated effort under way from several organizations [61][62], to bring internet to even the world poorest communities. With the prices of computing technology decreasing, NEO should become accessible by everybody at the time the new economy becomes instituted.

Objections might be also brought up against the particular ways, the NEO founding principles are implemented. A likely candidate is the Rovas implementation of the equal effort rule, which guarantees access to advance payment to workers for simply reporting their work hours. It can be expected, that the number of hours reported will not be accurate and may be inflated. In that case, two outcomes are possible - either such payments will be held in the workers' accounts, or they would be spent. Chrons which are not spent however do not pose any threat to the economy, as they are eventually removed from the circulation, when the value they represent disappears from the economy. The Chrons that do get spend will increase the average size of profits in the economy and that will lead to inflow of exchange value into the general NEO account, liquidating the debits from the advance payments. The constraint coded into Rovas, that ensures the number of worked hours is biologically sustainable, puts an upper limit to the number of hours a worker can report and thus also an upper limit to the amount of Chrons that could be issued for advance payments. Additionally, as the information stored in Rovas about assets will contain also their description and the location where they can be purchased. The society members will be able to verify existence of the claimed assets and therefore verify the work was performed. A feedback mechanism can be implemented in Rovas for reporting non-existent assets. The offending account could then be penalized, if a set number of complaints was received.

It can be expected, that not only false reporting of work hours will eventually stop, but with the growing income from the Universal Distribution, workers will cease to report the amount of their labor altogether, focusing instead on maximizing their competence reward. That shift will signify arrival of the new era in human history, in which most work is performed by machines, and the people are "living wisely and agreeably and well," imagined almost one hundred years ago by John Maynard Keynes.

Appendix B

Instituting NEO

The above-given brief outline of the NEO technological infrastructure suggests, that Rovas will ultimately be deployed onto a distributed storage/computing platform like [24], or [25]. In the interim period - before that production version is ready, a  "bootstrap" implementation of NEO will be developed, aiming for the following goals:

1. to track time and expenses using the NEO economic rules. The collected data will be transferred into the production version of Rovas, once it becomes operational,
2. to have a live demonstration environment for marketing purposes,
3. to create an environment suitable for field-testing/fine-tuning the economy rules.

Once the bootstrap version is complete, it will be open for registration to the developers working on the production version and to investors. The developer rewards (Chrons and Merits) and the investor rewards (Merits) will be funded according to the NEO rules - from advances for performed work, and from the revenues from sales of the Rovas application. Every installed copy of the ROvas application will incur a mandatory charge to the NEO participant. The charge will be small and will be deduced from thei Universal Distribution, once for every new version of Rovas.

After releasing the Rovas production version, the registration will be open for everyone.

[43] The likely to be misunderstood factors of production are knowledge and creativity, possession of which allow the endowed workers to perform a given task faster/better, than other, less-gifted workers. As a consequence, more knowledgeable workers are more productive and argument could be made, that they deserve larger exchange reward. However, knowledge employed in the production process has the attributes and effects of a physical tool. It increases productivity and workers must make an investment in order to acquire it. That makes knowledge indistinguishable from other factors of production. Thus, also expenses related to knowledge acquisition (tuition, cost of own study time..) can enter into profit calculation as costs.
When it comes to rewarding creativity, it is assumed here, that creativity is a quality, which can have positive as well as negative effects at the well being of society and that it is "allocated" among the society members by a random process. Considering, that the society carries the consequences of harmful actions of individuals endowed with "negative" creativity, society should be also the benefactor of the positive contributions made by the creative individuals. Thus creativity should not be a factor, affecting the amount of exchange reward received by an individual worker.

[51] From the human psychology point of view, coupling between motivation and the signaling aspect of labor income is in agreement with the Self-determination theory, [33] according to which, competence is one of three fundamental human needs (the other two being authonomy and relatedness), necessary for the experience of a fulfilling and meaningful life.

[55] However, initially no Chrons exist and therefore a newly-created asset can not be purchased, which means, that no new Chrons can be created, as the sale price is not known.
[56] It can be expected, that payment processing companies will eventually be created, which will issue payment cards-like instruments, to make purchasing in non-NEO economies easy for the Chron holders.

[60] As the number of Chrons and Merits must be always equal, new Merits will be created as well. Those will be either given to the person(s) that made the gift, or deposited into the general NEO account, to be eventually liquidated at the rate with which value disappears from the economy.
