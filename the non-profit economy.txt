The non-profit economy

Introduction

This paper describes framework for a new economic model (NEO), built upon findings about relationship between income and happiness and growing global presence of non-profit volunteer work. These indicate, that a revision of the existing remuneration mechanism, that takes these finding into account, has potential to resolve some of the most pressing problems of the capitalist economic system.

There are two observations in particular that served as inspiration for the new model:

1. Behavioral economics research shows, that happiness rises with increasing income only to a certain level ($75,000 in the USA)[1].

2. Every year, about one billion people from around the world work for free, to produce socially beneficial output. In the process they generate value, that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by volunteers 7th on a list of the most GDP-producing economies[2].

From these findings an inference can be made, that once their basic material needs are satisfied, people loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy recognition from society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if their work is used and appreciated by other people. Based on these facts, the economic model proposed here explicitly rewards pro-social aspect of work, while establishing natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Thus - in contrast to the remuneration mechanism of capitalist economic system (wage) - in NEO, work reward consists of two separate types:

1. effort - for the number of hours spent by a worker to create a good or service (asset).
2. impact - for the (positive) difference between price of an asset and effort exerted to create it.

The proposed model further postulates:
a. workers are materially rewarded only for effort and not for impact,
b. the amount of  material reward received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. Profit from selling assets is distributed equally to all NEO participants as Universal distribution.

It is envisioned, that NEO rules will be implemented as a set of algorithms, running on global, decentralized computing platform.

Discussion

Deflationary tendencies in the most developed economies, together with increasing pace of human labor elimination by advances in technology, signal arrival of new phase in the history of mankind, known as post-scarcity world. In that era, the effort to provide support for our physical needs will be largerly eliminated and with it also the need for (material) remuneration. The transition from capitalism into post-scarcity era presents several challenges.

1. Peer effects

Research shows, that peer effects, combined with wage amount differences result in emergence of differentiated consumption (consumption visibility gradient), that members of society use as a guide for improving their own social standing [18]. Most often, such efforts take form of learning new skills, which brings along overall improvements in social capital. Loss of this motivation mechanism would therefore be detrimental to cultural progress of individuals and the society in general.

Coincidentally, the same technological advances that make transition to the post-scarcity world possible, also lead to creation of the internet and on-line social networks. Soon after they reached certain size, new value scales emerged, used to express various characteristics of the network members. For example, reputation score generated by users is an expression of expertise level on the stackexchange.com and service reddit.com rewards users with karma points, that signify popularity of posts. In the on-line world, these measures serve as a new signaling mechanism. Such ratings can be made visible in the physical world using wearable technology and augmented reality applications, allowing their wearers/users to access ratings of various characteristics of other individuals as they are observed, creating a new kind of motivation scale, equivalent to the consumption visibility gradient.

2. Economic inequality

A major obstacle to overcome on the path to post-scarcity economy is finding a solution for the problem of income inequality. Fore one, income inequality results in concentration of wealth, causing decrease of purchasing power for the majority of consumers. That leads to economic stagnation and other economic and social problems [14]. Additionally, existence of material differences between people is contradicting the basic premise of the new era - material equality.

Solutions for addressing income inequality proposed to date are generally considered ineffective or politically unacceptable (for example raising taxtes on wealthy). The results of behavior science research and other related evidence [1][2][6] reveals, that a more systemic solution can be found, rooted in a revision of the capitalist remuneration. In particular, the evidence suggest, that workers expect to be rewarded for their work in two different ways:

A. For their "effort" - the time/energy invested into work. Similar to the wage of capitalist reward mechanism, "effort" reward can be used to satisfy the "material" needs and wants of workers (food, shelter, clothing, travel, entertainment...).

B. Once their material needs are addressed, workers try to maximize "impact" reward, reflected in desirability of assets they (co)create. Impact reward is the driving force behind the open source movement or volunteering in general. 

The capitalist remuneration system does not distinguish between these two needs, and rewards workers with a single - material - reward. When impact reward far exceeds the effort reward - as is the case with remuneration of company executives, hedge fund managers, exceptionally good athletes or famous actors -  resources are wasted on rewards, that could be granted in non-material form. In capitalism, the way the visibility consumption gradient is constructed therefore inevitably leads to income inequalities. Introducing a new remuneration mechanism, where impact reward takes "non-material" form, offers the possibility of eliminating the primary cause of income inequality.

3. Profit and reward

As was shown above, replacing the single-component remuneration mechanism of capitalist system with a new one, consisting of separate rewards for "effort" and "impact" could both - eliminate income inequality and at the same time maintain the useful "motivation" gradient. This brings up a problem of how the proceeds from sale of assets should be split between the two new rewards. In the capitalist economic model, the sale price of an asset, as well as workers' reward are determined by the market, making the task to construct a simple, general rule for allocating rewards difficult. To find a solution, simplified model can be studied, where work time is used as a carrier of value:

In an imaginary tribe, berry picker "A" can pick 1 liter of berries in 1 hour with her bare hands. The value of 1 liter of berries, expressed in the currency of the tribe is 1 H (equal to 1 hour of labor). Another - a more inventive - member of the tribe "B" creates a wooden comb, that increases productivity 10-folds to 10 litres per hour. Now the worker B has a surpluss of berries and needs to sell them. If the market demand is high, she can charge 1H for 1 liter. If there are many sellers of berries, she can lower the price, and sell them faster. In either case, she will generate profit, attributable to the use of her harvesting invention. Profit is calculated by adding the time needed to make the comb to the one hour of actual harvesting and substracting the resulting number from the sales proceeds:

P = R - (Ct + Ht)

P	profit
R	revenue
Ct	time spend creating the comb
Ht	time spent harvesting

In actual numbers, her profit is P = 10 - (3 + 1)  = 6H (if we assume it took 3 hours to create the comb). In the future, profit will be of course higher for selling the collected berries, because the cost of harvesting comb has been already paid when the first batch of berries was sold.

In the capitalist system, any benefits resulting from talent and inventions of all types (including business processes) are considered a rightfull property of the gifted owner. This is one of the fundamental assumptions of the capitalist economic system. However, a strong evidence exists, that the most highly rewarded component of any novel or exceptional asset - creativity (and especially its extreme form - genius) - is a statistical phenomenon, occurring in human population randomly [23]. In other words, the unique insight that lead our inventor to create the invention is not the result of her effort and rewarding her materially for the profit it generates is therefore incorrect. This conclusion leads to a solution to the problem of how to divide reveunue among the two types of rewards:

1. workers should be materially rewarded only for their time/energy exerted, not for profit generated by their work,
2. a worker who created profit-generating asset should receive non-material reward, equivalent in size to the profit amount.

Description of NEO

The findings made in the discussion section indicate, that creation of a new economic model should be possible, that keeps the best features of the capitalist system, while eliminating most of its problems.


It is envisioned, that both new reward measures will exist only virtually, Chrons as digital currency stored in private accounts and Merits as numerical score, visible to the pubic. There will be no material objects (coins, bills) representing these measures that NEO participants could pass from one to another, but there might be technical solutions allowing physical representation of the Merit score, for example using augmented reality techniques within wearable devices, allowing users to see each other's Merit score.


For this purpose, NEO introduces a non-material reward type called "Merit," granted to workers for profit generated by selling assets they create. The Merit score is calculated and maintained by a NEO-resident computer program "Rovas", running on every device used to manage economic transactions in NEO.

Rovas in it's distributed database will also record the actual time workers spent working, information about the assets the workers produced, as well as details about sales. Material rewards workers earn are paid with digital currency called "Chron" with one Chron equal to one hour of work. 

Both rewards are calculated and granted by algorithm ("Rovas"), from data provided by the workers and sales information from users of the produced assets. Value of one Chron is equal to one hour of labor

The following example illustrates the basic concepts and functions of the model.

Example: An entrepreneur creating a web application.

An entrepreneur starts work by creating a new project in Rovas, providing information like name of the project, its description, e.t.c.. Upon submitting, Rovas will generate unique project ID and associates it with the entrepreneur's ID.

As she works on the project, the entrepreneur keeps recording her work time. If third party tools are needed to complete the project, she will purchase them and record their Rovas asset IDs (a kind of project ID). Tools without ID do not have to be recorded - they have either been purchased outside of NEO and therefore are not paid with Chrons or the entrepreneur decided not to report such asset use.

In order to measure utility, the entrepreneur will embed a special Rovas-connecting code into the web application, in order to process payments received from users, or record information about their usage. Lastly, the entrepreneur or another worker charged with selling the web application will have to choose a suitable monetizing strategy. Any of many strategies common in the capitalist economies can be used.

In a scenario where access is allowed only to authenticated users who pay a set price, web application user authenticates into Rovas[20] and confirms the payment. A transaction, containing ID of the user, is sent into Rovas, together with project ID. The Chrons from user's account (managed by Rovas) are transferred into NEO common account and user is granted access into application. 
Rovas will add together all payments received from all buyers and substract them from all costs. If the result is positive (profit was reached), our entrepreneur as well as all other workers involved in the production are rewarded with Merits for portion of the generated profits. The workers participating on making, marketing and selling the web application must negotiate ahead of time, how Merits will be allocated between them and submit this information into Rovas.
All workers who participated on production will start receive (Chron) payments as soon as first web application users (buyers) start paying for access. After all production costs are paid, profit is stored in NEO common account and earmarked for Universal distribution.

NEO and the existing (outside) economy

Considering, that the proposed economic model will coexist with the outside economy for some time, some rules will need to be implemented, governing transfer of value between the outside economy and NEO.

1. At some point after NEO becomes operational, Chrons will be made available on currency markets to allow conversions to local currencies to allow NEO participants acquire goods from the "outside" economies and vice-versa, outside companies to buy goods traded in Chrons. It is hard to predict the exchange rate, but given that Chron is going to be always equal to one hour of human labor, its price should relatively quickly rise to at least the world average of minimum hourly wage. Due to the fact that price of human labor will be higher in NEO than the same amount of labor in local currencies of most of the world's poorest countries, consequences of this move will be dramatic. 

2. Governments and individual donors will be encouraged to donate money to the Neo common account. Such money will likely be used to buy Chrons in exchanges and subsequently distribute them as Universal Distribution into NEO participants. Optionally, states could create their own banks and use Chrons they purchase to finance state projects.

3. To provide incentive for people from outside economies to purchase Chrons, in addition to the already mentioned option to do so on the exchanges, these folks could opt to also buy Merits. The reason is, that money earned in the capitalist economy represent a mixture of effort and impact rewards and thus people should be able to exchange for Chrons as well as Merits. The procedure would involve exchanging fiat money into Chrons first and then optionally buy Merits using the - at the time - current Chron to Merit ratio of the NEO economy. It can be expected, that there will always be much more Chrons generated in a given period that Merits, therefore also the ratio will be quite small. It might mean that for 10 000 Chrons it would be possible to get only couple of Merits. That should have double impact - allow rich fiat currency holders to receive some Merits for their money and at the same time not provide much incentives for NEO workers to try to buy Merits with their Chrons as Merits should be generally non-tradeable. The most important part is, that the more interest there is in Chrons, the more self-sufficient NEO will become and greater demand for Chrons should improve exchange rate thus even more accelerating transition from capitalist to the NEO economy....

Appendix

The second scenario is similar to the first one, if the buyer pays some amount according to his/her choosing. Buyers who make choice not to pay anything will be penalized either materially by having some portion of their Universal distribution withdrawn, and/or 

but this choice will lower the amount of Universal distribution the buyer will receive from NEO (mecahnism to be described later). A score derived from the average price paid by buyers of pay-as-you-wish assets and the price paid by a particular buyer will be visible to all users in order to promote pro-social behavior.

The third scenario, where anonymous users are allowed access to assets will likely be used only during transition period from capitalist to the NEO economy. It is envisioned, that in this case assets creators will not receive any Merits, but will be paid for at least a portion of their costs from funds received from sources like government subsidies wishing to promote employment and from charitable donations who accummuated wealth in the capitalist economies. Rules for these transactions will have to be developed.




Suppose the entrepreneur invested 1000 hours into creating the web application (asset 1) and paid 10 chrons to acquire asset 2 (for example a program with specific functionality, that is needed in the web application). The total cost of web application is then 1010 chrons. Let's further assume, that the consumers collectively paid 2000 chrons for accessing the web application.

The rewards will be shared between the asset 1 and asset 2 creators in the following way:

• Asset 1 creator (our entrepreneur) will receive 1000 chrons
• Asset 2 creator will receive 10 chrons
• Contribution to the Neo common account will be 990 chrons

• Asset 1 creator will receive (1000/1010)*990 = 980 merits
• Asset 2 creator will receive (10/1010)*990 = 10 merits


The amount of merits the asset creator receives will be calculated dynamically, as it depends on the number of purchases. Our entrepreneur would see her merit score grow with each new paying consumer. An important feaure of NEO is propagation of merit, which means that also creators of the assets used to create the web application would receive portion of merits - as shown above.

From the consumer point of view, upon arriving to the web application, they will be prompted to log in with their NEO account credentials. After successful login, one of these two scenarios would play out:

1. the entrepreneur specified "pay as much as you want" option in the Minimum price field. The consumer could make the voluntary payment at the time when accessing the web application, or continue without paying. Once a month the consumer will receive a NEO usage statement, listing all assets the account holder consumed but not paid for yet, that were priced with "pay as much as you want" value in the Minimum price field. The consumer could choose to pay individually for every asset, or specify one amount for all unpaid items, leaving it up to Rovas to distribute the payments.

2. The consumer would be prompted on the web application to pay for access by paying the Minimum price.

The above is an example from the digital domain. In the physical domain, an asset creator would have to contend with issues like how to control access to an asset (a lecture, use of skating ring, entry into an event,), or how to register (identify and count) NEO consumers. Given the dramatic technological developments we see on a daily basis, associated with quickly decreasing costs of electronics of all kinds, it can be expected that inexpensive devices capable of scanning NEO consumer's IDs (biometric, wearable devices, e.t.c.) powered by ambient energy sources and connected to an ubiquitous network will soon make connection between the physical and digital domains possible and affordable.




The capitalist remuneration mechanism leads to concentration of material wealth into hands of a small group of people, which in turns leads to deformations in economy (market manipulations, declining purchasing power by the majority of market participants...), political life (the role of big money in representative domocracies) and other areas (charity).


Nomenclature

Non-human labor - labor performed by robots, software programs, automata.

Non-human-labor-generated value - asset value created by non-human labor. Includes also portion of value created by human labor - one made possible by use of tools. For example, a hole in the ground can be dug by bare hands, by using a showel, or an excavator. Value created in these three cases is increasing in listed order, because labor of human worker is made more productive by use of tools.

NEO - Economy built around the model described in this proposal (New Economic Order)

NEO participant - a person who has an account in NEO and participates economically in NEO

asset - a physical or virtual product, or service. A synonym to asset is "project"

consumer - a buyer or user of an asset.

Chron -  measure of "effort"; is the "material" currency of NEO, generated by human labor and issued by Rovas algorithm. Represents one hour of work.

Merit - measure for social "impact" of work. Considering that assets are most of the time produced by multiple workers, the impact reward granted to each of them is calculated by the following formula:

M = (h/H)*P  where:

M is size of the impact reward a worker receives
h is the number of hours a worker invested into making an asset
H is te sum of hours invested by all workers who participated on making an asset
P is the profit gained from the sale of the good 

NEO project - *****
Project Form - *****
Work Record Form - *****
Rovas asset ID - ***** 

Neo common account - an account holding Chrons that bellong to all members of NEO. These funds could be used to fund expensive projects (highways, starships...), serve as a source of universal distribution, e.t.c...

Rovas[5] - the distributed database/application, responsible for storing work reports, calculating rewards and implementing other NEO algorithms.

Rovas application - The user-facing part of Rovas, allowing workers to create projects, records about work they have performed, or to see all assets they visited during a given period of time.



Notes:

1. It is possible that the character of large projects financing will change from the current centralised model to one based on ad-hoc crowdsourcing, where individuals themselves will be financing projects they like. This might be the preferred option as it gives more direct control over use of funds to the people who finance projects.

2. A physiological limit exists for the number of hours during which an individual can sustainably perform work and the algorithm "running" NEO will not allow workers to report more worked hours than this limit.
