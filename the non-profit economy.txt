The non-profit economy

Introduction

This paper describes framework for a new economic model (NEO), built upon findings about relationship between income and happiness and global presence of non-profit volunteer work. These indicate, that a revision of the existing remuneration mechanism, that takes these finding into account, has potential to resolve some of the most pressing problems of the capitalist economic system.

There are two observations in particular that served as inspiration for the new model:

1. Behavioral economics research shows, that emotional happiness rises with increasing income only to a certain country-specific level ($75,000 in the USA)[1].

2. Every year, about one billion people from around the world work for free, to produce socially beneficial output. In the process they generate value, that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by volunteers 7th on a list of the most GDP-producing economies[2].

From these findings an inference can be made, that once their basic material needs are satisfied, people loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy recognition from society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if their work is used and appreciated by other people. Based on these facts, the economic model proposed here explicitly rewards pro-social aspect of work, while establishing a natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Thus - in contrast to the remuneration mechanism of capitalist economic system (wage) - in NEO, work reward consists of two separate types:

1. effort - for the number of hours spent by a worker to create a good or service (asset).
2. impact - for the (positive) difference between price of an asset and effort exerted to create it.

The proposed model further postulates:
a. workers are materially rewarded only for effort and not for impact,
b. the amount of  material reward received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. Profit from selling assets is distributed equally to all NEO participants as Universal distribution.

It is envisioned, that NEO rules will be implemented as a set of algorithms, running on global, decentralized computing platform.

Discussion

Deflationary tendencies in the most developed economies, together with increasing pace of human labor elimination by advances in technology signal arrival of new phase in the history of mankind, known as post-scarcity world. In that era, the effort to provide support for our physical needs will be eliminated and with it also the need for (material) remuneration. The transition from capitalism into the new era presents several challenges.

1. Peer effects

Research shows, that peer effects, combined with wage amount differences result in emergence of differentiated consumption (consumption visibility gradient), that members of society use as a guide for improving their own social standing [18]. Most often, such efforts take form of learning new skills, which brings along overall improvements in social capital. Loss of this motivation mechanism - inevitable in the materially equal post-scarcity world - would therefore be detrimental to cultural progress of individuals and the society in general.

Coincidentally, the same technological advances that make transition to the post-scarcity world possible also lead to creation of the internet and on-line social networks. Soon after they reached certain size, new value scales emerged, used to express various characteristics of the network members. For example, reputation score generated by users is an expression of expertise level on the stackexchange.com. Similarly, the news service reddit.com rewards users with karma points, that signify popularity of posts they make. In the on-line world, these measures serve as a foundation of a new kind of motivation scale. Such ratings can be made visible in the physical world using wearable technology and augmented reality applications, allowing their wearers/users to learn about various characteristics of other individuals as they are observed, creating a functional equivalent to the consumption visibility gradient.

2. Economic inequality

A major obstacle to overcome on the path to post-scarcity world is finding solution for the problem of income inequality. Fore one, it leads to concentration of wealth, causing decrease of purchasing power for the majority of consumers, causing economic stagnation and other economic and social problems [14], blocking movement towards post-scarcity world. Additionally, existence of material differences between people is contradicting the basic premise of the new era - material equality.

Solutions for addressing income inequality proposed to date have either not found the necessary support among economists, or are politically unacceptable (for example raising taxtes on wealthy). The results of behavior science research and other related evidence [1][2][6] however reveal, that a more systemic solution can be found, rooted in revision of the capitalist remuneration. In particular, the evidence can be interpreted, that workers expect to be rewarded for their work in two different ways:

A. For their "effort" - the time/energy invested into work. Similar to the wage of capitalist reward mechanism, "effort" reward can be used to satisfy the "material" needs and wants of workers (food, shelter, clothing, travel, entertainment...).

B. Workers also try to maximize "impact" of their work, reflected in desirability of assets they (co)create. This reward type is what motivates people to work on all kinds of pro-bono projects, including community work, or open source program development. It is also likely the dominant motivation factor to generate profit, especially in cases when workers' income already reached the emotional well-being maximum as identified in [1].

The capitalist remuneration system does not distinguish between these two needs, and rewards workers with a single - material - reward. This feature of capitalist system is likely the basis for income inequality, further exacerbated by the wealth-compounding mechanism described by Piketty [3]. Introducing a new remuneration mechanism, where impact reward takes "non-material" form, therefore offers a possibility to eliminate the primary cause of income and by implication also wealth inequalities.

3. Profit and reward

As was shown above, replacing the single-component remuneration mechanism of capitalist system with a new one, consisting of distinct rewards for "effort" and "impact" could both - eliminate income inequality and at the same time maintain the useful "motivation" gradient. This brings up a problem of how revenue generated by labor should be divided between the two reward types. In the capitalist economic system, the sale price of an asset, as well as workers' reward are determined by the market, making the task to construct a simple, general rule for allocating rewards difficult. To find a solution, a simplified model can be studied instead, where work time is used as a carrier of value:

In an imaginary tribe, berry picker "A" can pick 1 liter of berries in 1 hour with her bare hands. The value of 1 liter of berries, expressed in the currency of the tribe is 1 H (equal to 1 hour of labor). Another - a more inventive - member of the tribe "B" creates a wooden comb, that increases productivity 10-fold, to 10 litres per hour. Now the worker B has a surpluss of berries and needs to sell them. If the market demand is high, she can charge 1H for 1 liter. If there are many sellers of berries, she can lower the price, and sell them faster. In either case, she will generate profit, attributable to the use of her harvesting invention. Profit is calculated by adding the time needed to make the comb to the one hour of actual harvesting and substracting the resulting number from the sales proceeds:

P = R - (Ct + Ht)

P	profit
R	revenue
Ct	time spend creating the comb
Ht	time spent harvesting

In actual numbers, her profit is P = 10 - (3 + 1)  = 6H (if we assume it took 3 hours to create the comb). In the future, profit will be of course higher for selling the collected berries, because the cost of the harvesting comb has been already paid when the first batch of berries was sold.

In the capitalist system, any benefits resulting from worker talent and inventiveness are considered a rightfull property of the gifted owner. This is one of the fundamental assumptions of the capitalist economic system. However, a strong evidence exists, that the human abilities necessary for production of any novel or exceptional asset, like creativity (and especially its extreme form - genius), are a statistical phenomenon, occurring in human population randomly [23]. In other words, the unique insight that lead our inventor to create the invention is not the result of her effort and rewarding her materially for the profit it generates is therefore incorrect. This conclusion leads to a solution to the problem of how to divide reveunue among the two types of rewards:

1. workers should be materially rewarded only for their time/energy exerted, not for profit generated by their work,
2. a worker who created profit-generating asset should receive non-material reward, equivalent in size to the profit amount.
3. the reward for profit belongs to the entity that is the source of the exceptional abilities of individuals - the totality of individuals called mankind.

Description of NEO

In this section an economic model - NEO - is described, that implements the discussed ideas. This new model can be viewed as a refinement of the capitalist economic model. The main differences are:

1. no physical currency - all transactions are virtual,
2. existence of two types of rewards - for effort (material) and for impact (non-material),
3. workers are materially rewarded only for the actual time spent working, regardless of the work type. For profit resulting from their output, workers receive non-material reward,
4. (matewrial) profit from sales is not property of the worker who created it. Instead, it is used to fund Universal distribution payments issued to all people. The recipients must be NEO participants to access the benefits, as there is no physical currency to distribute them (see point #1)

1. The most visible difference between NEO and the capitalst economy is non-existence of physial money in NEO. Common value transactions like purchases of goods or payments for services are initiated from portable personal computers, (semi)permanently connected to the internet. These devices, together with stationary computing resources form a secure and robust computing platform, running computer algorithms, called "Rovas" [5]. These are responsible for all computing tasks of the NEO economy, like user authentication, processing, or storing data. A precursor of the technology can be found in the Safe network [24], or Ethereum [25].

2. There are two new reward types in NEO and two corresponding types of measures. The carrier of "material" value in NEO is a digital currency, called "Chron" [26]. It equals to one hour of human labor. Monetary policy (creating and destroying Chrons, setting inflation rate, e.t.c.) will be described elsewhere, but in general, Chrons will be issued when new value is created in NEO.

The non-material reward, granted to workers for profit from assets they produce is called "Merit". The Merit score is calculated (and stored) in "Rovas". One Merit is numerically equal to one Chron.

3. Just as is the case in the capitalist economy, also in NEO workers will be motivated to maximize profit, in order to:
a. get paid for their work and for any costs incurred while working,
b. increase their Merit score, which is issued only if work leads to creation of profit-generating good or service.

Equality of effort can be illustrated by an example: A physician is paid exactly the same amout of Chrons for one hour of work as a seasonal farm worker. However, the physician can claim portion of education costs as an expense, as from the economic point of view, training of any kind is considered a productivity-increasing tool. For generating profit, the physician will receive Merits in the amount equal to the profit.

4. Wealth generated by profit is periodically and evenly distributed to all NEO participants as a Universal distribution. NEO participantion is going to be open to all people and will likely require physical presence at certified institutions to prevent multiple Rovas identities for a single person.

The following example illustrates the basic concepts and functions of NEO.

Example 1: An entrepreneur creating a web application.

An entrepreneur starts work by creating a new project in Rovas, providing information like name of the project, its description, e.t.c.. Upon submitting, Rovas will generate unique project ID and associates it with the entrepreneur's ID. As she works on the project, the entrepreneur keeps recording her work time. If third party tools are needed to complete the project, she will purchase them and record their Rovas asset IDs (a kind of project ID). Tools without ID do not have to be recorded - they have either been purchased outside of NEO and therefore are not paid with Chrons or the entrepreneur decided not to report such asset use. A special type of assets that she might want to report are expenses paid to acquire any special skills, for example school tuition, because knowledge has the same productivity-enhancing effect as a specialised tool.

In order to record sales, the entrepreneur will embed a code into the web application, connecting it into Rovas. This will allow automatic processing of payments received from users, or record information about usage of the web application. Lastly, the entrepreneur or another worker charged with selling the web application will have to choose a suitable monetizing strategy. Any of the strategies common in the capitalist economies can be used.

For example, in a scenario where access is allowed only to authenticated users who pay a set price, the buyer authenticates into Rovas[20] and confirms payment. The web application will send a transaction into Rovas, containing ID of the user, together with project ID. The Chrons from user's account (managed by Rovas) are transferred into NEO common account and user is granted access into application. 

Rovas will add together all payments received from all buyers and substract them from all costs. If the result is positive (profit was reached), our entrepreneur as well as all other workers involved in the asset lifecycle (conception, design... sales, delivery) are rewarded with Merits for portion of the generated profits. The workers participating on making, marketing and selling the web application must negotiate ahead of time, how Merits will be allocated between them and submit this information into Rovas. If they omit to do so, all impact reward will be assigned to the project owner.
All workers who participated on production will start receive (Chron) payments as soon as first web application users (buyers) start paying for access. After all production costs are paid, profit is stored in NEO common account and earmarked for Universal distribution.

NEO and the existing (outside) economy

Considering, that the proposed economic model will coexist with the outside economy for some time, some rules will need to be implemented, governing transfer of value between the outside economy and NEO.

1. At some point after NEO becomes operational, Chrons will be made available on currency markets to allow conversions to local currencies to allow NEO participants acquire goods from the "outside" economies and vice-versa, outside companies to buy goods traded in Chrons. It is hard to predict the exchange rate, but given that Chron is going to be always equal to one hour of human labor, its price should relatively quickly rise to at least the world average of minimum hourly wage. Due to the fact that price of human labor will be higher in NEO than the same amount of labor in local currencies of most of the world's poorest countries, consequences of this move will be dramatic. 

2. Governments and individual donors will be encouraged to donate money to the Neo common account. Such money will likely be used to buy Chrons in exchanges and subsequently distribute them as Universal Distribution into NEO participants. Optionally, states could create their own banks and use Chrons they purchase to finance state projects.

3. To provide incentive for people from outside economies to purchase Chrons, in addition to the already mentioned option to do so on the exchanges, these folks could opt to also buy Merits. The reason is, that money earned in the capitalist economy represent a mixture of effort and impact rewards and thus people should be able to exchange for Chrons as well as Merits. The procedure would involve exchanging fiat money into Chrons first and then optionally buy Merits using the - at the time - current Chron to Merit ratio of the NEO economy. It can be expected, that there will always be much more Chrons generated in a given period that Merits, therefore also the ratio will be quite small. It might mean that for 10 000 Chrons it would be possible to get only couple of Merits. That should have double impact - allow rich fiat currency holders to receive some Merits for their money and at the same time not provide much incentives for NEO workers to try to buy Merits with their Chrons as Merits should be generally non-tradeable. The most important part is, that the more interest there is in Chrons, the more self-sufficient NEO will become and greater demand for Chrons should improve exchange rate thus even more accelerating transition from capitalist to the NEO economy....

Appendix

The second scenario is similar to the first one, if the buyer pays some amount according to his/her choosing. Buyers who make choice not to pay anything will be penalized either materially by having some portion of their Universal distribution withdrawn, and/or 

but this choice will lower the amount of Universal distribution the buyer will receive from NEO (mecahnism to be described later). A score derived from the average price paid by buyers of pay-as-you-wish assets and the price paid by a particular buyer will be visible to all users in order to promote pro-social behavior.

The third scenario, where anonymous users are allowed access to assets will likely be used only during transition period from capitalist to the NEO economy. It is envisioned, that in this case assets creators will not receive any Merits, but will be paid for at least a portion of their costs from funds received from sources like government subsidies wishing to promote employment and from charitable donations who accummuated wealth in the capitalist economies. Rules for these transactions will have to be developed.




Suppose the entrepreneur invested 1000 hours into creating the web application (asset 1) and paid 10 chrons to acquire asset 2 (for example a program with specific functionality, that is needed in the web application). The total cost of web application is then 1010 chrons. Let's further assume, that the consumers collectively paid 2000 chrons for accessing the web application.

The rewards will be shared between the asset 1 and asset 2 creators in the following way:

• Asset 1 creator (our entrepreneur) will receive 1000 chrons
• Asset 2 creator will receive 10 chrons
• Contribution to the Neo common account will be 990 chrons

• Asset 1 creator will receive (1000/1010)*990 = 980 merits
• Asset 2 creator will receive (10/1010)*990 = 10 merits


The amount of merits the asset creator receives will be calculated dynamically, as it depends on the number of purchases. Our entrepreneur would see her merit score grow with each new paying consumer. An important feaure of NEO is propagation of merit, which means that also creators of the assets used to create the web application would receive portion of merits - as shown above.

From the consumer point of view, upon arriving to the web application, they will be prompted to log in with their NEO account credentials. After successful login, one of these two scenarios would play out:

1. the entrepreneur specified "pay as much as you want" option in the Minimum price field. The consumer could make the voluntary payment at the time when accessing the web application, or continue without paying. Once a month the consumer will receive a NEO usage statement, listing all assets the account holder consumed but not paid for yet, that were priced with "pay as much as you want" value in the Minimum price field. The consumer could choose to pay individually for every asset, or specify one amount for all unpaid items, leaving it up to Rovas to distribute the payments.

2. The consumer would be prompted on the web application to pay for access by paying the Minimum price.

The above is an example from the digital domain. In the physical domain, an asset creator would have to contend with issues like how to control access to an asset (a lecture, use of skating ring, entry into an event,), or how to register (identify and count) NEO consumers. Given the dramatic technological developments we see on a daily basis, associated with quickly decreasing costs of electronics of all kinds, it can be expected that inexpensive devices capable of scanning NEO consumer's IDs (biometric, wearable devices, e.t.c.) powered by ambient energy sources and connected to an ubiquitous network will soon make connection between the physical and digital domains possible and affordable.




The capitalist remuneration mechanism leads to concentration of material wealth into hands of a small group of people, which in turns leads to deformations in economy (market manipulations, declining purchasing power by the majority of market participants...), political life (the role of big money in representative domocracies) and other areas (charity).


Nomenclature

Non-human labor - labor performed by robots, software programs, automata.

Non-human-labor-generated value - asset value created by non-human labor. Includes also portion of value created by human labor - one made possible by use of tools. For example, a hole in the ground can be dug by bare hands, by using a showel, or an excavator. Value created in these three cases is increasing in listed order, because labor of human worker is made more productive by use of tools.

NEO - Economy built around the model described in this proposal (New Economic Order)

NEO participant - a person who has an account in NEO and participates economically in NEO

asset - a physical or virtual product, or service. A synonym to asset is "project"

consumer - a buyer or user of an asset.

Chron -  measure of "effort"; is the "material" currency of NEO, generated by human labor and issued by Rovas algorithm. Represents one hour of work.

Merit - measure for social "impact" of work. Considering that assets are most of the time produced by multiple workers, the impact reward granted to each of them is calculated by the following formula:

M = (h/H)*P  where:

M is size of the impact reward a worker receives
h is the number of hours a worker invested into making an asset
H is te sum of hours invested by all workers who participated on making an asset
P is the profit gained from the sale of the good 

NEO project - *****
Project Form - *****
Work Record Form - *****
Rovas asset ID - ***** 

Neo common account - an account holding Chrons that bellong to all members of NEO. These funds could be used to fund expensive projects (highways, starships...), serve as a source of universal distribution, e.t.c...

Rovas[5] - the distributed database/application, responsible for storing work reports, calculating rewards and implementing other NEO algorithms.

Rovas application - The user-facing part of Rovas, allowing workers to create projects, records about work they have performed, or to see all assets they visited during a given period of time.



Notes:

1. It is possible that the character of large projects financing will change from the current centralised model to one based on ad-hoc crowdsourcing, where individuals themselves will be financing projects they like. This might be the preferred option as it gives more direct control over use of funds to the people who finance projects.

2. A physiological limit exists for the number of hours during which an individual can sustainably perform work and the algorithm "running" NEO will not allow workers to report more worked hours than this limit.
