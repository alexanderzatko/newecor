The merit economy

Introduction

"..Now it is true that the needs of human beings may seem to be insatiable. But they fall into two classes â€“ those needs which are absolute in the sense that we feel them whatever the situation of our fellow human beings may be, and those which are relative in the sense that we feel them only if their satisfaction lifts us above, makes us feel superior to, our fellows. Needs of the second class, those which satisfy the desire for superiority, may indeed be insatiable; for the higher the general level, the higher still are they. But this is not so true of the absolute needs - a point may soon be reached, much sooner perhaps than we are all of us aware of, when these needs are satisfied in the sense that we prefer to devote our further energies to non-economic purposes..."

John M. Keynes, Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren

The premise of this paper is, that technological advances are providing humans not only with means but needs as well and these changes require a new type of economy.

This paper presents framework for a new economic model (NEO), based upon behavior research-identified dual nature of work reward and the unequal impact these functions have on worker motivation. The competence signaling function 

 two effects - its size is a competence signaling 



This paper presents framework for a new economic model (NEO), built upon results of research about effects of remuneration on worker motivation and incorporating ideas and experiences from two existing non-capitalist economic systems - the volunteer economy and Timebanking.

There are two observations in particular that served as inspiration for the new model:

1. Behavioral economics research shows, that emotional happiness rises with increasing income only up to a certain country-specific level ($75,000 in the USA)[1]. Further income increases either do not contribute to growth of happiness or have the opposite effect.

2. Every year, more than a billion people from around the world work for free, to produce socially beneficial output. In the process they generate value, that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by volunteers 7th on a list of the most GDP-producing economies[2].
 

From these and other observations an inference can be made, that once their basic material needs are satisfied, people loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy recognition from society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if their work is used and appreciated by other people. Based on these ideas, the economic model proposed here rewards pro-social aspect of work by a non-material score, while establishing a natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Thus - in contrast to the remuneration mechanism of capitalist economic system (wage) - in NEO, work reward consists of two separate types:

1. effort - for the number of hours spent by workers to create a good or service (asset). This reward can be exchanged for other assets.
2. impact - a numerical score, equal to the total sales revenue from an asset made by the rewarded worker. This reward is a reflection of individual worker abilities, therefore can't be traded for goods or services.

The proposed model further postulates:
a. workers are materially rewarded only for effort and not for impact,
b. the amount of  material reward received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. The part of revenue remaining after workers are rewarded for effort (profit) is distributed equally to all NEO participants as Universal distribution.

It is envisioned, that NEO rules will be implemented as and enforced by a set of algorithms, running on global, decentralized computing platform.

Discussion

In 1930, in his essay "Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren" John M. Keynes [37] described a vision of the world economy "hundred years hence", where most labor is done by machines, the economic problem solved and human interest changed to "live wisely and agreeably and well". Fifteen years remain to realize the vision and due to the rapid advances in technology, deliberations about the end of human labor have moved from the realm of science fiction to scientific publications and articels in mass media. To make the vision a reality however, several obstacles will have to resolved first.

1. Economic inequality

The World Economic Forum identified growing income inequality as one of the most pressing problems facing the world economy today, affecting not only the world economy, but the social order as well [14]. In the economic sphere, income and saving rate inequality are causing wealth concentration, not seen since the beginnig of the last century. For example, in the US in 2012 the top 0.1% owned 20% of the country wealth [29] the prognosis points to even greater inequality [tbd]. Yet, the solutions to the problem proposed to date have not found sufficient support among economists, or have been unacceptable politically. The results from the field of behavioral economics research however suggest, that remuneration mechanism incorporating new knowledge about worker motivation, can provide the sougth after solution to the inequality problem. 

The reward system of the capitalist economy is built upon certain assumptions, concerning the effects of work reward on worker motivation: 
a. the salient property of reward affecting motivation is its exchange value,
b. the source of reward (own labor, investments gains...) is not important for motivation, only the reward size.
However, the results of research find these assumptions incorrect. The study [30] shows, that in addition to being a carrier of exchange value, work reward has also a second - competence signaling - function, if the reward source is labor of the rewarded worker. Additionally, workers are motivated to increase work effort only if source of the reward is their labor; rewards originating from other sources, like stock gains or lottery winnings, do not have the same effect. In other words, workers' primary interest is to maximize the competence signaling aspect of their reward and not its exchange value. 

The model of worker motivation emerging from these findigs presents a likely answer to the question of the income inequality origin. In capitalist system, the competence signaling function of reward is inseparable from its exchange function and therefore any attempt to reward competence, necessarily grants the recipient the exchange reward as well. However, the pool of the available exchange reward resources is finite, while the desire to maximize the competence reward is unbounded. Rewarding high performers according to their perceived impact thus leads to a zero sum game, where these individuals receive bulk of the resources [31]. Separating the two functions would allow setting the competence signaling reward as high as necessary, without affecting the amount of the exchange reward, thus eliminating the likely main cause of income inequality.

2. Profit and reward

A hypotehtical economy, where the exchange and competence signaling functions are split into separate rewards can be modeled by analyzing two existing non-capitalist economic systems, that implement reward systems with only one of these functions.

The $1,348.1 billion volunteer economy [2] is a system, where workers are rewarded for their labor with pure competence-signaling reward. The form of the reward varies for different types of services. For example, in the open source application development, competence might be signaled by the number of application installations, while in more traditional activities like community development work, volunteers are rewarded by gratitude expressed by the service recipients. In all cases, the size of the reward reflects utility of the created product or service rendered. The global presence of this economy and the signifficant value it generates are a testament to the power of pure competence reward.

Example of a system utilizing reward with only the exchange function is Timebanking - a type of complementary currency - where one hour of work of any kind earns one time credit, exchangeable for an hour of another worker's work. For example, one hour of a doctor's work is considered equal in value to one hour of gardener's work. The model of worker motivation built upon results of behavior research however predicts, that due to the absence of the competence signaling function in the reward, economies of this kind should not in general be viable in the long-term. A recent Timebanking study [35] confirms this prediction. It found an over time decreasing participation of timebank members, reluctance of higly-skilled members to trade their work for time credits and other issues. 

Yet, time-based remuneration is the base of not only alternative economic systems like Timebanking, but the mainstream ones as well. For example, the capitalist remuneration would not be different from Timebanking, if all of its economy actors had the same expertise. In that case, any differences in rewards recevied by different workers would be attributable exclusively to the amount of their effort, commonly measured by the length of work time. Therefore in systems, where competence is rewarded separately, work of any type, performed with the same effort (taking the same length of time), caries the same exchange value.

These example show, that a remuneration mechanism, that combines utility-based competence signaling reward with a separate time-based exchange reward, should - in the worker motivation domain - be equivalent to the capitalist system. It can be expected, that similar to the capitalist reward mechanism, also this new form of remuneration will motivate workers to maximize the revenues from sales of the assets they make, as they are also the measure of utility of the asset, and therefore the worker's competence. The drive to maximize competence will often lead to production of profit, which raises question of who should be its recipient, as the workers receive only exchange reward, equal to the number of their worked hours.

Any discussion that concerns trading of heterogeneous items of unequal quantities must necessarily deal with the notion of exchange value. It is a concept whose interpretation usually defines economic systems and the new remuneration mechanism presented here does not break that tradition. The new definition is a combination of concepts from well-known theories of value [40], and some new ideas:

1. The source of value is the total sum of energy, used by the processes that transform assets into their specific form and function. For example, a physical good might be created by a worker using tools and machines. The worker needs certain amount of energy to perform the work and so do the machines. The tools and machines themselves were created by other workers, using tools and machines, that also consumed energy. Those tools and machines alse needed to be made by somebody and energy was needed for that as well, e.t.c.. A part of the chain are also geological processes, that accumulated dispersed atoms into concentrated deposits of ore, from which parts of the tools were made; and the atoms themselves were forged by nuclear processes in the stars and supernovae. In addition to physical tools, the workers use also intangible tools, like knowledge, or its close equivalent, software programs. Creation and acquisition of knowledge is also fueled by energy, which is necessary for cognitive tasks like choosing from alternative theories, testing, copying, e.t.c. Service-type assets differ from goods little - by use of a larger proportion of intangible tools.

2. The value of an asset is portion of the total pool of the transformative energy spent to form the asset. The exact amount of energy - and therefore the value of the asset - is determined by the market forces, as understood by the Austrian School [41].

This definition of value allows identification of the profit recipients. Considering, that profit is the portion of asset value remaining after the costs are subtracted, the profit recipients are the entities, that made most contributions to the asset's pool of transformative energy. By following the chain of transformations it is apparent, that the entities which performed those them are mostly non-human - the forces of nature that created such essential attributes of human existence like space, time or air. As those attributes are considered the common heritage of all of mankind, also profit belongs to the mankind as a whole.

A second line of reasoning that identifies the profit recipient is simpler and is based on the research- and evidence-confirmed human needs:

The assumptions we as individuals hold about property rights (and therefore also profit ownership), are according to Eswaran and Neary [28] part of a survival mechanism, that evolved under competition for scarce resources. One of those assumptions is the right to own resources developed by own labor, which in capitalism is manifested by the appropriation of profits by the individual who produced them. Yet, our assumptions about individual property rights loose their validity, when well-being of whole groups of people is considered. Various types of taxes levied on income and personal property by governments of all historic periods and economic systems, are in a direct contradiction to the assumption of ownership right to the resources developed by own labor.

The resulting conflict between interests of the individual and the collective can be resolved by adopting a new perspective on property rights, reflecting the fact, that rewards for products of labor cary two kinds of value - the competence signalling measure, that belongs fully to the worker and the exchange value, that includes profit and whose rightful owner is the collective. Such property rights model would satisfy the research-identified motivation needs of workers and at the same time provide funding for an universal distribution scheme like basic income [9], which is increasingly considered by economists as the best option for addressing social and economic problems attributable to (technological) unemployment.


Description of NEO

Described here is framework of an economic system (NEO), that incorporates the new remuneration mechanism and the property rights model, discussed in the previous section. The system assumes most of the institutions of the capitalist economy, therefore only the new rules and supporting concepts are described. As the goal is to provide just enough information to illustrate the high level functions of NEO, detailed description will be made available at a later time [38]. 

the infrastructure

In a departure from the capitalist system, which expects its actors to know and follow the economy rules, NEO delegates this responsibility to a set of software algorithms ("Rovas" [5]), running on a computing platform consisting of networked computers owned by the economy participants (like [24] or [25]). From the governance point of view, the software will be developed by following the open source principles. New Rovas versions will be possible to install only with the explicit agreement of the node owners. 

In addition to the economy rules, Rovas will also implement interfaces to allow the actors perform various tasks, like create projects, enter work reports, pay for assets, manage their profile information, e.t.c.

the economy actors

Any person wanting to participate in the NEO economy will have to get a Rovas account. The registration process will - among other requirements - ensure that the applicant has exactly one account and his/her official name is used to register (no anonymous accounts). Biometric information will also be collected to support various usage scenarios (authentication, payments authorization...).

the rewards

The NEO remuneration mechanism has two rewards. The carrier of the exchange value is a new digital currency called "Chron," where one Chron represents the value created by one hour of labor [26]. 

 which occurs in two cases:
1. every time worker submits a work report. For every reported hour of work one Chron is created and immediately credited into the worker's Rovas-based account.
2. an asset sales revenue is greater that the costs. New Chrons are generated for each Chron paid 


The worker remains in possession of the assets created by the reported work, still responsible for finding a buyer and selling it. The assets buyers  pay by authorising transactions of Chrons from their accounts into the Rovas NEO account. Rovas uses those funds to liquidate the loans by destroying the raised Chrons. If more revenue is raised from sales than 


He or she is motivated by the desire to earn competence reward, as its size is equal to the revenues from the asset sale. Once it is sold, a portion of the payment no larger than the cost of the purchased asset (the amount credited to the worker who made it) is destroyed. The rest 


Submitting work reports for fictive work will be illegal and enforced by the following mechanisms:
1. by limiting the number of hours that is physically possible to perform during reported period (humans can't work 24 hours a day 7 days a week, day has only 24 hours...)
2. existence (not utility) of an asset will be possible to verify by Rovas, by a direct inquiry. On-line assets will have built-in code for collecting payments and usage information and physical assets will for the same reason eventually have built-in sensors and computers.
3. It is expected, that by far the most effective deterrent will be the fact, that non-existent work output will not generate any sales and therefore earn no merits.

Another aspect of the exchange value remuneration is, that all actually performed work will be rewarded for the time invested, regardless of the produced asset utility. This decision is driven by the fact, that even work with no apparent use may play positive role indirectly, as a factor other workers consider, when producing more successful work. Furthermore, utility of an asset often becomes apparent only after a signifficant delay, when the worker who created it can't be rewarded any more.


The NEO competence signaling measure is called "Merit." It is calculated by Rovas from the revenues raised from sales of assets and in the form of a numeric score assigned to the worker(s) who created them. Merit score can only grow over time and is non-tradeable as it is a reflection of its owner's competence. The score will be publicly accessible, together with details about the assets, for which it was earned.

If the produced asset contains work of more than one worker, Rovas will assign Merits by following one of these criteria:
a. solo worker not using any tools
b. solo worker using tools
c. multiple workers



3. Merits are granted by Rovas to every worker who directly or indirectly participated on creation of an asset. Each of them receives a portion of the revenue generated by sale of assets they made, the size of which depends on several factors, described in the example below.  



The following example illustrates the basic concepts and functions of NEO.

Example 1: An entrepreneur creating a web application.

An entrepreneur starts work by creating a new project in Rovas, providing information like name of the project, its description, e.t.c.. Upon submitting, Rovas will generate unique project ID and associates it with the entrepreneur's ID. As she works on the project, the entrepreneur keeps recording her work time. If third party tools are needed to complete the project, she will purchase them and record their Rovas asset IDs (a kind of project ID). Tools without ID do not have to be recorded - they have either been purchased outside of NEO and therefore are not paid with Chrons or the entrepreneur decided not to report such asset use.

In order to record sales, the entrepreneur will embed speciel code into the web application, connecting it into Rovas. This will allow automatic processing of payments received from users, or record information about usage of the web application. Lastly, the entrepreneur or another worker charged with selling the web application will have to choose a suitable monetizing strategy. Any of the strategies common in the capitalist economy can be used.

For example, in a scenario where access is allowed only to authenticated users who pay a set price, the buyer authenticates into Rovas[20] and confirms payment. The web application will send a transaction into Rovas containing ID of the buyer, together with project ID. The Chrons from buyer's account (managed by Rovas) are transferred into NEO common account and the buyer is granted access into application. 

Rovas will add together all payments received from all buyers and substract them from all costs. Every Chron earned will get divided among workers involved in the asset production lifecycle (conception, design... sales, delivery) according to the number of work hours invested into creating the asset. To account for differences in the amount of training or education, better trained workers will be able to claim portion of their training costs as an expense and get paid more. Education and training expenses in NEO are considered to be costs. Tools increase productivity, or allow workers to perform actions that can not be done without them, so they must be compensated for their costs. The exact amount of such costs will probably have to be negotiated among the worker and the project owner, as the amount of specialised expertise provided by training will warry with the type of task performed.

All workers will also receive Merits for their work. The Merit reward will consist of two parts:

1. the base component, numerically equal to the worker' Chron reward
2. the negotiable component, reflecting a concrete worker's contribution to the market success of the good or service produced (profit). As we presently do not know how to measure individual intellectual contributions to products developed collectively, each worker's share of the total Merit reward will have to be negotiated by the workers.

Total Merit reward for a concrete worker:

Mw = Mbi + P*Ii

Mbi - the base Merit reward amount. It is equal to the number of Chrons earned by the rewarded worker
P - profit, equal to total revenue minus costs
Ii - the contribution of the rewarded worker to the asset's market success. The concrete amount (from interval 0 - 1) will likely have to be negotiated by the workers. There could be a default value for this parameter in Rovas, derived from the Mbi, by formula:

Iid = CHw/CHt

CHw - the number of Chrons earned by the worker
CHt - revenue (the total number of Chrons earned from asset sales)

As Mbi = CHw, and CHt = R (revenue), the final Merit reward would be calculated by:

Mw = CHw + P*CHw/R = CHw*(1 + P/R)


All workers participating on the production will start receive (Chron) payments as soon as first web application users (buyers) start paying for access. After all production costs are paid, profit is stored in Rovas and earmarked for Universal distribution.

NEO and the existing (outside) economy

Considering, that the proposed economic model will coexist with the outside economy for some time, some rules will need to be implemented, governing transfer of value between the outside economy and NEO.

1. At some point after NEO becomes operational, Chrons will be made available on currency markets to allow conversions to foreign currencies to allow NEO participants acquire goods from the "outside" economies and vice-versa, outside companies to buy goods traded in Chrons. It is hard to predict the exchange rate, but given that Chron is going to be always equal to one hour of human labor, its price should relatively quickly rise to at least the world average of minimum hourly wage. Due to the fact that price of human labor will be higher in NEO than the same amount of labor in local currencies of most of the world's poorest countries, economic benefits of NEO will first be manifested on mass scale in those countries.

2. Governments and individual donors will be encouraged to donate money to Neo. Such money will be used to buy Chrons in exchanges (making exchange rates more favorable to Chron holders) and subsequently distribute them as Universal Distribution to the NEO participants.

3. To provide incentive for people from outside economies to purchase Chrons, it should be possible also to buy Merits. The reason is, that money earned in the capitalist economy represent a mixture of effort and impact rewards and thus people should receive for their foreign currency not only Chrons, but also Merits. The procedure would involve exchanging foreign currency into Chrons first and then buying Merits using the - at the time current - Chron to Merit ratio of the NEO economy. It can be expected, that there will always be much more Chrons generated in a given period that Merits, therefore also the ratio will be quite small. It might mean that for 10 000 Chrons it would be possible to get only couple of Merits. 
Option to buy Merits should have double impact - allow rich foreign currency holders to receive some Merits for their money and at the same time not provide much incentives to NEO workers to buy Merits with their Chrons, because Merits should be generally non-tradeable. The most important part is, that interest in Chrons should improve exchange rate, which should further increase participation in the NEO economy.

Conclusion

According to Self-Determination Theory [http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/theory/]

"...Conditions supporting the individualâ€™s experience of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are argued to foster the most volitional and high quality forms of motivation and engagement for activities, including enhanced performance, persistence, and creativity. In addition SDT proposes that the degree to which any of these three psychological needs is unsupported or thwarted within a social context will have a robust detrimental impact on wellness in that setting..."



Appendix

but this choice will lower the amount of Universal distribution the buyer will receive from NEO (mecahnism to be described later). A score derived from the average price paid by buyers of pay-as-you-wish assets and the price paid by a particular buyer will be visible to all users in order to promote pro-social behavior.

The third scenario, where anonymous users are allowed access to assets will likely be used only during transition period from capitalist to the NEO economy. It is envisioned, that in this case assets creators will not receive any Merits, but will be paid for at least a portion of their costs from funds received from sources like government subsidies wishing to promote employment and from charitable donations who accummuated wealth in the capitalist economies. Rules for these transactions will have to be developed.

Separating competence and exchange functions will likely have a side effect of killing attractiveness of inheritance, because the recipient will receive no (coveted) merits. The exchange value gained will be useless in NEO.


Suppose the entrepreneur invested 1000 hours into creating the web application (asset 1) and paid 10 chrons to acquire asset 2 (for example a program with specific functionality, that is needed in the web application). The total cost of web application is then 1010 chrons. Let's further assume, that the consumers collectively paid 2000 chrons for accessing the web application.

The rewards will be shared between the asset 1 and asset 2 creators in the following way:

â€¢ Asset 1 creator (our entrepreneur) will receive 1000 chrons
â€¢ Asset 2 creator will receive 10 chrons
â€¢ Contribution to the Neo common account will be 990 chrons

â€¢ Asset 1 creator will receive (1000/1010)*990 = 980 merits
â€¢ Asset 2 creator will receive (10/1010)*990 = 10 merits


The amount of merits the asset creator receives will be calculated dynamically, as it depends on the number of purchases. Our entrepreneur would see her merit score grow with each new paying consumer. An important feaure of NEO is propagation of merit, which means that also creators of the assets used to create the web application would receive portion of merits - as shown above.

From the consumer point of view, upon arriving to the web application, they will be prompted to log in with their NEO account credentials. After successful login, one of these two scenarios would play out:

1. the entrepreneur specified "pay as much as you want" option in the Minimum price field. The consumer could make the voluntary payment at the time when accessing the web application, or continue without paying. Once a month the consumer will receive a NEO usage statement, listing all assets the account holder consumed but not paid for yet, that were priced with "pay as much as you want" value in the Minimum price field. The consumer could choose to pay individually for every asset, or specify one amount for all unpaid items, leaving it up to Rovas to distribute the payments.

2. The consumer would be prompted on the web application to pay for access by paying the Minimum price.

The above is an example from the digital domain. In the physical domain, an asset creator would have to contend with issues like how to control access to an asset (a lecture, use of skating ring, entry into an event,), or how to register (identify and count) NEO consumers. Given the dramatic technological developments we see on a daily basis, associated with quickly decreasing costs of electronics of all kinds, it can be expected that inexpensive devices capable of scanning NEO consumer's IDs (biometric, wearable devices, e.t.c.) powered by ambient energy sources and connected to an ubiquitous network will soon make connection between the physical and digital domains possible and affordable.
