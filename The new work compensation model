Summary

1. Recent studies in the field of behavioral economics revealed, that happiness of people rises with increasing income only up to a certain income level. Once this level is reached, money looses ability to make people happier.
2. Every year, about one billion people from around the world volunteer their time to produce socially useful work. In the process, they generate value that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by these volunteers on the 7th place in a list of the most GDP-producing countries.

From these and other facts an inference can be made that people - once their basic material needs are satisfied - loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy more recognition from society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if they feel that products of their work is used and appreciated by other people. These conclusions lead to development of a new model of work compensation, which explicitly rewards pro-social aspect of work and puts natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Implementing the proposed model in real economies should lead to fair distribution of and access to products and services, while giving workers a measure of their pro-social contributions.

Characteristics of the proposed model

In the new model, work compensation consists of two different kinds of rewards:
1. for the number of "fully engaged[1]" hours a particular job took to complete (effort), 
2. for the number of people benefiting from the product or service rendered by the effort (impact).

The new model further postulates:
a. workers are materially compensated only for effort and not for impact,
b. the size of  material compensation received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. workers are rewarded for impact of their work by a new, non-tradeable measure reflecting the number of people benefiting from the performed work.

Discussion

The current economy needs a new way of rewarding people for the economic value they create, because the existing work compensation mechanism leads to excessive concentration of wealth in the hands of a small group of people. This has been identified by a growing number of economists as the main problem threatening the stability of the world economy. The most often suggested remedy is progressive taxation, but it is associated with problems. The most obvious is, how to set the rates high enough, without negatively affect motivation of people to work. A related problem is, how should governements distribute the money fairly, while maintaining the motivation of the recipients to seek work.

The model proposed here is suggesting to eliminate the possibility of excessive wealth concentration altogether by splitting work compensation into two different kinds of rewards. One - for the number of hours a job took to complete - should allow the recipient to acquire products and services. This reward type is similar to the existing wage, but there is an important difference - the relative value a worker can earn for an hour of work does not depend on the type of work performed. This for example means, that an hour of computer programmer's work is rewarded materially the same, as one hour of a farm worker's labor. The main reason for this constrain is, that both individuals are putting their best effort into their respective assignemnts. Of course it is obvious that there is an important difference between these example jobs, in the level of expertise they require.

is built on an observation, that the currently most common type of work compensation (wage) has two components. One for the time the worker spent to complete the job and the other is expression of popularity of the completed product or service in the marketplace. The need to treat these aspects separately stems from results of behavioral studies which found out that once people have their material needs fulfilled, they want their work to be useful to the society. The current system is inefficient because workers are often rewarded materially even after their material needs have been already fulfilled while at the same time they do not receive any feedback for the pro-social aspect of their work. This leads to treating material compensation to be a measure of the pro-social impact of their work.


products  this  small fraction of a product or service value is added by their creators. Therefore most of the benefits new producst and services provide should belong to mankind as a whole.

2. Lack of essential life necessities like shelter, food, sanitation or access to quality health services that currently affects billions of people is not a matter of constrains posed by nature, but a product of economic system that is not working. 
3. The world is a hostile place to the ones without an idea how it works and the shared human knowledge provides a map that made homo sapiens the most successful species on our planet. 

ability of individuals as well as mankind as a whole to anticipate and deal with catastrophes depends on quality of the common human knowledge. It is possible that not only our well being, but the ability to survive itself depends on how quickly we can build our understanding of the world.


the more people can contribute to building our world model quality of this effort, mankind needs more educated people. However, most of the world population lives in economic hardship which hampers intellectual growth. Economic liberation is therefore the most important step that can be made in building up our survival abilities.

One, that provides access to goods and services essential for humans like food, shelter or clothing. The other part provides a worker with feedback about social value of the product or service produced. In case of work compensation used currently in the most world economies (wage) the components are not easily separable. Their presence must be derived from the effects that wage of various amounts has on behavior of the recipient. If there was only one component, worker satisfaction would grow proportionally to the compensation amount and volunteer work would be done only by masochists.

The way people get compensated for work performed on behalf of others had not fundamentally changed for millennia. In the most common scenario, a worker and employer agree on certain amount and type of compensation, and after the job is completed, worker gets paid by the employer. The pay amount is determined by factors like intensity and length of time the work takes to complete, skill level, competition on the job market, state of the economy (expanding, contracting), etc.

The amount of compensation is also changing over time, due mainly to increases in productivity, which tends to exert a downward pressure on the amount of compensation for given type of work. Additionally, old kinds of jobs are at an increasing pace eliminated. New jobs are also created, most of them falling  into one of two categories - jobs not requiring any special skills at the low end of the pay spectrum and well paid work that requires specialized knowledge. To maintain or improve their standard of living, the rapidly changing work place is thus forcing workers to learn new skills. 
However, combination of the recalcitrant education methods and rapid evolution of skills requirements in the high paying jobs category are placing these out of reach for most unemployed workers. The outcome is, that a growing segment of population is ending up working in (often more than one) low paying jobs, or in the safety net.
