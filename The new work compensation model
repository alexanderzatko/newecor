Introduction

1. Recent studies in the field of behavioral economics revealed, that happiness of people rises with increasing income only up to a certain income level. Once this level is reached, money looses ability to make people happier.
2. Every year, about one billion people from around the world volunteer their time to produce socially useful work. In the process, they generate value that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by these volunteers on the 7th place in a list of the most GDP-producing countries.

From these and other facts an inference can be made that people - once their basic material needs are satisfied - loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy more recognition from society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if they feel that their work is used and appreciated by other people. These conclusions lead to development of a new model of work compensation, which explicitly rewards pro-social aspect of work and puts natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Implementing the proposed model in real economies should lead to fair distribution of and access to products and services, while giving workers measure of their pro-social contributions.

Characteristics of the proposed model

In the new model work compensation consists of two different kinds of rewards:
1. for the number of "fully engaged[1]" hours a particular job took to complete (effort), 
2. for the number of people benefiting from the product or service rendered by the effort (impact).

The new model further postulates:
a. workers are materially compensated only for effort and not for impact,
b. the size of  material compensation received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. workers are rewarded for impact of their work by a new, non-tradeable measure reflecting the number of people benefiting from the performed work.

Discussion

The world economy needs a new way of rewarding people for the economic value they create, because the existing work compensation mechanism leads to excessive concentration of wealth in the hands of a small group of people while a growing segment of population does not have means to cover their basic existential needs. This has been identified by a growing number of economists as the main problem threatening stability of the world economy.

The remedy suggested most often to address this problem is progressive taxation, but it is associated with problems. The most obvious is, how to set the rates high enough, without negatively affecting motivation of people to work. A related problem is, how should governements distribute the tax money fairly, while maintaining motivation of the recipients to seek employment.

The model proposed here is suggesting to eliminate the possibility of excessive wealth concentration altogether. To accomplish this, it suggests splitting work compensation into two different kinds of rewards. One - the "effort" type - for the number of hours a job takes to complete. This reward is in the form that can be exchanged for goods and services. It is similar to the existing wage, but there is an important difference. In the effort reward, the relative value a worker can earn for an hour of work does not depend on the kind of work performed. This means for example, that an hour of computer programmer's work is rewarded materially the same, as one hour of a farm worker's manual labor. The main reason for postulating this constrain is that both individuals are putting their best effort into their respective assignments. It is obvious that there are differences between these two examples. During work, the computer programmer barely moves a muscle in her body, while her mind is engaged in an activity that required years of effort to master. On the other hand, the farmer's mind is most of the time engaged in much less abstract work, while his body carries the brunt of the effort needed to complete the assignment. A valid question is, whether people in occupations that require long years of training would feel less motivated to work in their fields, if they did not receive more compensation than people working in less intellectually demanding fields. The historical evidence from failed socialist economies seems to indicate that this would be the case. However, while workers of all occupations in those economies were receiving more-less equal amount of pay, several important factors were also in play. For one, these were planned economies, where enterpreneurship was actively supressed. Furthermore, the amount of compensation a worker receives fulfills another role besides being source of means to address physical needs. It is an important indicator of the value one's work provides to the society. That explains also the fact, that even though doctors and engineers in socialist economies who underwent years of studying in universities received the same wages as much less educated workers, interest in these intellectually demanding occupations was always great. The reason is twofold - many people choose to study to address their desire to expand their knowledge - a factor that has nothing to do with material compensation or status in society. A second reason is that the high social status associated with occupations requiring university degrees compensated for the lack of material reward.

As can be seen, social aspect of work compensation is an important factor that in the proposed model acquires form of a second type of reward. The "impact" aspect of work is the number of people who benefit from an individual's work. 

An important feature of material compensation is it's physical form, which makes it easily presentable to the public. Big houses, expensive cars and exotic vacations have always been used to communicate status of individuals to the public, thus creating a powerful motivator for people to work on advancing their own social standing. The "impact" measure of the proposed model does not have a physical form, but there are technical means to accomplish this. Details will be discussed in the "implementation" section.
