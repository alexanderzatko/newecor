Summary

1. Recent studies in the field of behavioral economics revealed, that happiness of people rises with increasing income only up to a certain income level. Once this level is reached, money looses ability to make people happier.
2. Every year, about one billion people from around the world volunteer their time to produce socially useful work. In the process, they generate value that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by these volunteers on the 7th place in a list of the most GDP-producing countries.

From these and other facts an inference can be made, that people - once their basic material needs are satisfied - loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy more recognition from the society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if they feel that their work has positive impact on society. These conclusions lead to development of a new model of work compensation, which explicitly rewards pro-social aspect of work and puts natural limit on size of material compensation a worker can receive. Implementing the proposed model in real economies should lead to equal distribution of access to products and services, while providing a measure of pro-social "worth" of every individual.

Characteristics of the proposed model

Work compensation consists of two different kinds of rewards:
A. for the number of "fully engaged*" hours the work took to complete (effort), 
B. for the number of people benefiting from the product or service rendered by the effort (impact).

The new model further postulates:
D. workers are materially compensated only for effort and not for impact,
E. the size of  material compensation received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
F. workers are rewarded for impact of their work by a new, non-tradeable measure.

Analysis

The way people get compensated for work performed on behalf of others had not fundamentally changed for millennia. In the most common scenario, a worker and employer agree on certain amount and type of compensation, and after the job is completed, worker gets paid by the employer. The pay amount is determined by factors like intensity and length of time the work takes to complete, skill level, competition on the job market, state of the economy (expanding, contracting), etc.

The amount of compensation is also changing over time, due mainly to increases in productivity, which tends to exert a downward pressure on the amount of compensation for given type of work. Additionally, old kinds of jobs are at an increasing pace eliminated. New jobs are also created, most of them falling  into one of two categories - jobs not requiring any special skills at the low end of the pay spectrum and well paid work that requires specialized knowledge. To maintain or improve their standard of living, the rapidly changing work place is thus forcing workers to learn new skills. 
However, combination of the recalcitrant education methods and rapid evolution of skills requirements in the high paying jobs category are placing these out of reach for most unemployed workers. The outcome is, that a growing segment of population is ending up working in (often more than one) low paying jobs, or in the safety net.
