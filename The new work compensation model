Summary

1. Recent studies in the field of behavioral economics revealed, that happiness of people rises with their rising income only up to a certain income level. Once this level is reached, money looses ability to make people happier.
2. Every year, about one billion people from around the world volunteer their time to produce socially useful work. In the process, they generate value that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by these volunteers on the 7th place in a list of the most GDP-producing countries.

From these and other facts an inference can be made, that people - once their basic material needs are satisfied - loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy more recognition from the society. Another observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if they feel that their work has a positive impact on society. These conclusions lead to development of a new model of work compensation, that has important advantages when compared to the current compensation model (wage). 

In the new model proposed here, work compensation consists of two different kinds of rewards:
A. for the number of "fully engaged*" hours the work took to complete (effort), 
B. for the number of people benefiting from the product or service rendered by the effort (impact).

The new model further postulates:
1. workers are materially compensated only for effort and not for impact,
2. the size of  material compensation received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
3. workers are rewarded for impact of their work by a new, non-tradeable measure.

The paper provides arguments for choices made in the new model, suggests how to implement it in a real economy and ends with a discussion about impact of the implementation on society.

Analysis

The way people get compensated for work performed on behalf of others had not fundamentally changed for millennia. In the most common scenario, a worker and employer agree on certain amount and type of compensation, and after job is completed, worker gets paid by the employer. The pay amount is determined by factors like intensity and length of time the work took to complete, skill level, competition on the job market, state of the economy (expanding, contracting), etc.
The amount of compensation is also changing over time, due mainly to increases in productivity. This tends to exert a downward pressure on the amount of compensation for given type of work. Additionally, old kinds of jobs are at an increasing pace eliminated, and new ones created. Most newly created jobs fall into one of two groups - jobs not requiring any special skills at the low end of the pay spectrum and well paid work that requires specialized knowledge. Thus, to ensure that the relative amount of compensation is not falling, workers are forced to constantly learn new skills, or settle for the low paying jobs. Both of these approaches have their own set of problems. Compensation for low skill jobs allows only barely maintain one's existence and often people working in such occupations work overtime in multiple jobs to earn enough money for their basic needs.
The other kind of new jobs are generally available only to workers with specialized skills, which currently can be acquired only by utilizing traditional learning methods. The innovations in the education sphere have however not been able to keep up with rapid evolution of demands the high paying jobs have. The outcome is that a growing segment of work-able population is ending up in low paying jobs or the safety net. The loss of economic opportunities also causes loss of social status and this has devastating effect on the society.
