Introduction

1. Recent behavioral economics studies revealed, that happiness of people rises with increasing income only up to a certain income level. Once this level is reached, money looses power to make people happier.
2. Every year, about one billion people from around the world volunteer their time to produce socially useful work. In the process, they generate value that would place a hypothetical country inhabited by volunteers on the 7th place in a list of the most GDP-producing countries.

From these and other similar findings an inference can be made, that people - once their basic material needs are satisfied - loose interest to work for material reward, if that can not buy recognition from society. A related observation is, that people will work without material compensation, if their work is used and appreciated by other people. These conclusions lead to development of a new model of work compensation, which explicitly rewards pro-social aspect of work and puts natural limit on the size of material compensation a worker can receive. Implementing the proposed model in world economies should lead to fair distribution of and access to products and services, while giving workers measure of their pro-social contributions.

Characteristics of the proposed model

In the new model, work compensation consists of two different kinds of rewards:
1. for the number of "fully engaged[1]" hours a particular job took to complete (effort), 
2. for the number of people benefiting from the product or service rendered by the effort (impact).

The new model further postulates:
a. workers are materially compensated only for effort and not for impact,
b. the size of  material compensation received is independent of the work type (equality of effort),
c. workers are rewarded for impact of their work by a new, non-tradeable measure reflecting the number of people benefiting from the performed work.
d. individuals can not own more material wealth than what they can realistically earn during their lifetime (wealth accummulation cap).

Discussion

The world economy needs a new way of rewarding people for the economic value they create, because the existing work compensation mechanism leads to excessive concentration of wealth in the hands of a small group of people, while a growing segment of population does not have means to cover their basic existential needs. This has been identified by a growing number of economists as the main problem threatening stability of the current world economy.

The remedy suggested most often to address this problem is progressive taxation, but this has known problems. The most obvious one is, how to set the rates high enough, without negatively affecting motivation of people to work. A related problem is, how should governements distribute the tax money fairly, while maintaining motivation of the recipients to seek employment.

The model proposed here is proposing to eliminate the possibility of excessive wealth concentration altogether. To accomplish this, it suggests splitting work compensation into two different kinds of rewards. One - the "effort" kind - for the number of hours a job takes to complete. This reward is in a form that can be exchanged for goods or services. It is similar to the existing wage, but there is an important difference. In the (new) effort reward type, the value of compensation a worker can earn for an hour of work does not depend on the kind of work performed. This means for example, that an hour of computer programmer's work is rewarded materially the same, as one hour of a farm worker's manual labor. The main assumption for postulating this constrain is that both individuals are exerting a comparable (mentally or physically taxing) effort into their respective assignments. It is obvious that there are differences between these two examples. During work, the computer programmer barely moves a muscle in her body, while her mind is engaged in an activity that required years of effort to master. On the other hand, the farmer's mind is most of the time engaged in much less abstract work, while his body carries the brunt of the effort needed to complete the job. A natural question is, whether people in occupations that require long years of training would feel less motivated to work in their fields, if they did not receive more material compensation than people working in less intellectually demanding fields. 

To judge an impact of (more-less) equal wages on motivation we can analyse situation of the socialist economies. It is tempting to attribute their ultimate failure to the equality of work compensation, but a closer scrutiny reveals more complicated picture. For one, these were planned economies, where freedoms of all kinds were suppressed and between them also freedom to create private businesses - the engine of economic growth in capitalist countries. Furthermore, wage amount fulfills another role besides determining the amount of material goods or services one can buy. It is also an indicator of the value, one's work provides to the society. This explains the fact, that even though doctors and engineers in socialist economies who underwent years of studying in universities received the same wages as much less educated workers, interest in these intellectually demanding occupations was always great. One reason is that many people chose to study to address their desire to expand their knowledge - a factor that has nothing to do with material compensation or status in the society. A second reason is, that the high social status associated with owning a university degree compensated for the lack of material reward.

As can be seen, social aspect of work compensation is an important factor that in the proposed model acquires form of a separate, major type of reward. This "impact" aspect of work is commensurable with the number of people who benefit from an individual's work.

The last postulate "d" is introduced to prevent accumulation of material wealth, which is a major known factor leading to economic instabilities [2]. In practical terms a worker can accummulate wealth only from his/her own work and not from sources like interest, gifts or inheritance. Wealth accumulated during worker's lifetime becomes common property after his/her death. Thus the important function resources accumulation fulfills in the traditional economy - to provide means for surviving adverse time periods - is delegated to the community.

Postulate "d" might not be necessary if individuals are unable to extract from their property rent.


Implementation

Nomenclature:
The engagement is paid in a currency we will call "equal", while impact of the effort is rewarded in "merits".

The basic unit of the proposed compensation model is a record containing 3 pieces of information:

1. ID of the worker who performed work,
2. the number of hours the work took,
3. ID of the project, product, or service produced.

In the simplest scenario, a worker produces a product which is subsequently bought by a single customer. Here the worker receives x equals and 1 merit. The customer pays x equals. The x is the number of hours the worker had to work to complete the product.

In a more realistic scenario, multiple workers will participate on a single project, which will be "consumed" by one or more customers. In this case, first a contribution of each worker will be calculated by dividing the number of hours worked by an individual worker by the total number of hours of all workers who worked on the product. Next, the number of customers will be divided by the individual contributions of each worker. The resulting number will determine the number of merits earned by each worker. The sum of equals paid by all the customers for the products will be equal to the sum of hours of all workers participating on manufacture of the product. In some cases the community (maybe represented by a government) will set a minimum price for the product or service to extract value for community-beneficial projects.

Such records will be stored in a distributed, redundant database. If the work performed by a single worker produces a product bought from the worker by a single customer, the price of the product will be equal to the number of hours that the work took. The impact 

* "normal" money received from governemnts, donors and own economic output will the NEO economy use to buy equals from "normal" businesses (merchants). NEO should guarantee that all equals will be possible to exchange for a normal currency. The amount of equals circulating in the NEO and available for exchange should be at least initially controlled to make sure that they are exchanged for real currency.


Conclusion

* NEO allows people to earn money for work on projects the current economy can not monetize.
