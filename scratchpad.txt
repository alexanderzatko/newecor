NEO - Economy built around the model described in this proposal

equal - an unit of material reward. It has value of 1 hour of work.

merit - an unit of social impact reward. It is calculated from the number of hours spent to make an asset and the number of it's consumers.

rovas - the distributed database/application responsible for storing work reports, calculating rewards and implementing other NEO algorithms.

asset - a physical or virtual product, or service

consumer - a buyer or user of assets.

basic income - an amount of equals automatically granted (once per defined period) into each NEO participant's account, if during defined period the balance should fall below a given limit. The exact amount will be calculated by rovas algorithm and depend on the strenght of NEO. Initially it will be low, but should grow with increasing strenght of NEO and the value of equal.


> buying contexts

• physical
	- user accessing physical objects like road, a community pool...
	
• virtual
	- accessing software applications, info sources like news articles or data in on-line databases...
	
> consumer types

1. consumer is a participant in NEO. It means that he/she has an on-line account, which provides access to digital assets. To access physical assets, this consumer type needs one of the following:

	a. a NEO ID card (not sure yet who, or how would issue it and what it would contain)
	b. a smartphone with a special application used to transfer consumer's ID
	c. a recorded biometric ID associated with consumer's NEO profile, that can be used for authentication.
	
2. buyer is not a NEO participant.

In the transition phase between current economy and NEO it is envisioned that also non-NEO-registered (anonymous) consumers could - at the asset creator's discretion - be allowed to gain access to NEO assets. In this scenario, a mechanism responsible for counting consumers that each NEO project should implement would count also anonymous consumers.

Use cases:

1. an individual or a group builds a passageway for some mode of transportation (car, bicycle, x-country ski). They use tools and machinery that other NEO workers produced. They acquired these in one of these ways:
	a. paid for them with loan from a bank-like institution
	b. received the tools without any payment because the the tool manufacturer decided to offer them using "dynamic payment pricing" when proceeds from sales of assets produced with the tools are shared between the tool and the asset creators.
	c. raised money to purchase the tools in an crowd-funding event.

The asset creators - knowing that they get rewarded only if it is known how many people use it, install device for counting consumers using the asset. Data from the counter is collected and submitted into rovas.

Workers working on the project would be compensated in eqals when the asset they produced is consumed. It means that they would not be rewarded for their work fully immediately, but the complete compensation in eqals should come over time with growing number of consumers.

The workers might decide to allow access to their asset to all types of consumers, or restrict it only to some types. 

• allow unrestricted access to asset and regularly send access log to NEO participants showing:
	• their current eqal and merit balances
	• list of assets they used with their actual prices in eqals
	• the current total cost for accessing all assets
	• a form control alowing user to adjust the amount of eqals he/she is willing to pay. Next to the set number of eqals could be shown the number of merits the buyer would get for paying - the more of the ballance is paid, the more merits buyer would earn.

After a (partial) payment is submitted, rovas would allocate funds received to all of the listed projects using some function (each receives the same percentage, or the projects with the greatest unpaid ballances get paid more, e.t.c...). This would lower the outstanding ballance on all projects. The rovas adjustment function can be constructed in such a way, as to present outstanding balance for popular projects even after they are fully paid to: 
	1. help pay for projects not fully paid yet
	2. return money to accounts of the earlier buyers who paid too much.
	
This way, eqals would be returned to the early buyers as more buyers would pay for the assets.

In the transitory stage when not enough eqals is collected from buyers to pay all asset-producing workers, the unpaid work can be paid by outside money donated to NEO by governemnts and donors.

QUESTION 1. implement controls to ensure only socially useful projects are (materially) rewarded?

ANSWER 1

• In NEO, projects that do not find consumers at the time of their introduction are not immediately rewarded. However, their creators will get paid for producing such assets in the future - once society finds them useful. In this respect rewarding in NEO is more fair, as inventors, scientists and artists whose work is often appreciated only after long time, will receive full reward eventually. In the current economy it is often the case that creative people are not the ones benefiting from their work, because once sold, they loose ability to benefit from the asset's rising value.

• Each NEO participant will receive basic income, which should - once equal acquires sufficient value - provide enough means to allow individuals lead decent life even if the assets they produce do not immediately find buyers.

QUESTION 2. How to fund expensive (multibuyer) projects?

ANSWER 2

• In funding big projects used by more than one buyer (roads, computer applications...), crowdfunding model can be used. A worker-enterpreneur would publish a crowdfunding project containing description and the amount of money sought to raise. Investors willing to support the project would pay price of their choosing into escrow account. Once sum of these contributions reaches the cost to make the asset, worker would receive the funds, create the asset and start selling it to the public. If any new buyers buy the asset, price for everybody will go down, beginning with the investors who contributed the most, getting paid first.

• a worker-enterpreneur can incentivize buyers with allocating a share of merits for early investors. He/she can offer his/her existing ones, allocate a fixed amount of the sales proceeds, or set a percentage of the received merit gains rewarded over the asset lifetime. Investors contributing the most would receive a share of merits proportional to their investment.


QUESTION 3. How to determine price of an asset?

ANSWER 3

• Price (eqals) of an asset is determined by the number of hours spent to create it. It is also a function of the number of consumers who buy it. In general the creator will have ability to set a minimum price for created asset. The price can range from 0 equals, to the number of hours it took to create the asset (including hours of "upstream" workers who produced the tools used).

• single buyer - the asset creator will most often set the price to the number of hours needed to create the asset. Examples: personal computer, house, car...

• multiple buyers - the asset creator can set minimum price and let consumers determine their own price. In this scenario the asset creator will not receive complete reward immediately, but will receive partial payments from individual buyers as they purchase the asset. Once the full price is paid, sale of the asset continues and the extra payments are distributed to accounts of all previous buyers to lower their previously-made payments. Thus, the cost of assets like roads, school classes, blogs or computer applications will decrease with the growing number of consumers buying (access to) them.

QUESTION 4. Should outside-NEO money be allowed to buy eqals?

ANSWER 4

• In general, NEO should be closed to outside money. This rule will probably slow NEO ascend to self-sufficiency, but it should prevent transfer of wealth inequality, which is in the long term the desirable outcome. However, there should be a way to reward NEO participants with outside money for work done in NEO during the transition phase. In this scenario, a worker producing an asset would allow access to it also to non-paying, consumers. There would have to be a mechanism implemented by the worker, capable of counting unique consumers. Those data would be used as a proof of work to the donors or governments who should thus be more inclined to pay workers with outside money. In a way, the non-paying consumers would pay indirectly through their governments or donor-provided distributions.

• There is a danger that workers might focus on growing the proportion of users who do not pay with eqals, in order to get paid in outside money. However, there are at least two mechanism how to steer workers toward prefering payments in NEO currencies. First - merits could be granted only for asset usage by consumers paying with equals and second, the payments in eqals should have greater purchasing power than reward paid in the outside currency.

• To provide an incentive to the outside donors merits might be paid for donated outside money and their amount should be proportional to the amount of hours on all accounts in NEO that were not paid with equals. This means that in the transitory stage donors would get more merits than at later times, because it is expected that with time, NEO economy will provide more diverse and more abundant services. That in turn will attract buyers into NEO and therefore also more of the NEO-generated assets will be purchased with equals. Eventually NEO will be self-sufficient and outside money will not be needed.

QUESTION 5. How should lending/giving money be handled?

ANSWER 5

• Equals can be transfered between individuals' accounts freely.

• Support for people who for various reasons can not earn money themselves should be handled by unconditional distribution (a.k.a. basic income).

• Money lending should be possible using bank-like institutions and lonas should be granted liberally. The amount an individual will be able to borrow should be determined by rules similar to the ones used in the current economy - trustworthiness of the borrower (using the merit score), history of previous loan repayments, etc...

• No interest should be charged on loans as concept of profit does not exist in NEO.


QUESTION 6. How to prevent abuse of the system?

ANSWER 6

• workers will be able to work on existing projects only if project owner accepts their application and it is in their interest to make sure workers produce value, because allowing workers who do not produce value dilutes their rewards. This practice is similar to the concept of hiring in the current economic system.
Of course it is possible that people could create projects and claim work that they did not perform, but this strategy will fail, as they will receive only as many equals as consumers pay for them.

• sybil attacks can be avoided by implementing approvals in the following way: A person interested in joining NEO will either want to work on an existing project, or create a new project. They can create accounts, but these will be in a pending status - where they will not qualify to receive basic income - until one of these options occurs:
a. the new user asks a project owner to join a project and that request is granted
b. the new user creates a project and hires (say) 3 registered user to work on it
c. (say) 5 users confirm validity and uniquenes of the request.


QUESTION 7. What are the incentives for participating in NEO?

ANSWER 7

• All participants will receive basic income. In transitory period this will be a more-less symbolic amount of equals. The exact number will be calculated by rovas and the controlling parameter will be performance (state) of NEO.

• In NEO - unlike in the current economy - workers are not rewarded once - at the time their product is offered on the market, but they continue receiving equals and merits as the consumer interest grows. That should result in a situation where sometimes workers will receive the bulk of reward for work that might be initially unpopular long after it was completed.

• In the transitory period workers who produce and sell an asset, but do not find enough NEO-registered consumers to cover the total asset cost, will be paid the difference in the currency of the existing economic system. That money will originate from governemnts and donors and will be deposited into workers' non-NEO bank accounts. A condition for receiving such payments is solid usage data that asset creator will gather by implementing usage measuring device. 


QUESTION 8. How to import tools, technologies and materials into NEO?

ANSWER 8

Initially, NEO will not be producing many tools needed to create assets and these will have to be "imported". The means for buying them will need to come from the governments and donors - the sources commonly used today to finance non-profit projects in the current economy. However, over time NEO will start producing it's own assets and among them will be also intelectual property and tools.

QUESTION 9. Should rewards trickle up the production chain?

ANSWER 9

• workers need tools to make assets. Their cost represents the amount of human labor invested to making them (cost of materials they are made of is negligible). The tool creators can be therefore considered collaborators in the process of asset creation and should be rewarded adequately in equals as well as in merits.

• accurate record keeping of tool purchases and asset sales are necessary for proper allocation of rewards. Businesses and individuals of the current economy are tracking these movements in order to file tax and other types of reports. Situation in NEO should not be very different in the data collecting aspect. It might be easier for calculations of rewards (and possible taxes if society decides to raise money that way) because those are performed by rovas automatically.
